<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>In the following pages an attempt has been made to
enable students to grasp the main points of the
contents of one of the most important philological
works which have been published during the last ten
or twenty years&mdash;Paul’s ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Principien der Sprachgeschichte.</span>’</p>

<p>With this object in view, that work has been here,
with more or less freedom, as the subject seemed to
demand, rewritten. Though a translation of Professor
Paul’s book has been published by one of the authors,
it has been felt that the existence of that translation
did not render a work like the present superfluous, nor
should a student whose interest has been awakened
by the reading of these pages consider he can dispense
with studying what Paul has written in his great
work.</p>

<p>It may be best to state in how far this and Professor
Paul’s book are alike, as well as in what points
they differ.</p>

<p>We have closely followed Paul in his division of
the subject. Our chapters correspond in number,
order, and subject with those of Paul. The views set
forth in our pages are in the main those of Paul; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
arguments are mostly his, even in the very few cases
(such as the question of the consistency and nature
of the laws of sound-change) where the authors might
feel inclined to differ from Paul’s views. Also the
order in which the various points in each chapter are
discussed has been generally preserved.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have altered much, as we
hope, in the interest of our readers. Professor Paul
wrote for Germans in the first place, and secondly for
such students as were able to read books like his in
the original, <i>i.e.</i> for those who not only knew German
enough to feel all the weight and import of his
German examples, but who also, like most German
students, could be assumed to possess a sufficiently
intelligent interest in the history of the German
language to appreciate quotations of its older forms
(a point which Englishmen have unfortunately too
much neglected), and who, thirdly, might be expected
to be sufficiently familiar with at least some of the
other languages from which he drew his quotations.</p>

<p>Now though, in deference to a generally expressed
opinion, a second edition of the translation of Paul’s
work is now in the press, in which all these examples
have been translated, this Englishing of the illustrations
will, we think, be found to be of use in but few
cases.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It is, in fact, almost invariably not so much
the mere word or sentence chosen as an illustration,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
as the peculiar form, its peculiar connotation, its
peculiar construction, which is of importance. All
these almost invariably disappear or differ in the
translation, unless such translation be accompanied by
such discussion and explanation as will bring out the
meaning <i>as an illustration of the point in question</i>. It
is self-evident that such additions in a translation
could not be thought of.</p>

<p>Moreover, Professor Paul very frequently follows
the German manner of exposition: first giving us the
statement of abstract principle, and then illustrative
examples. Though the authors are very far from
wishing to say that no English student could or would
follow this style of reasoning, they believe that it is
generally preferable to lead English students from the
concrete to the abstract.</p>

<p>All these considerations have led to the following
deviations from Professor Paul’s work.</p>

<p>Everything has been illustrated from English
wherever possible, and much also from French;
examples from other foreign languages have, as a
rule, been admitted only when they illustrated something
new, and even then an attempt has generally
been made to add such translations (literal and
idiomatic) as would enable the reader to appreciate
the force of the illustration, even without further
knowledge of the language from which it was taken.</p>

<p>The order of the argument has sometimes been
inverted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

<p>Where what was said seemed sufficient to explain
the nature and bearings of the subject of a chapter,
some minor points have sometimes been omitted.
They have not been omitted because they were thought
unimportant, but generally because they could not be
so well illustrated from English, and it was felt desirable
to economise space for a full discussion of everything
of which English <i>does</i> furnish illustrations. It
will consequently be found that some of our chapters
differ much more than others from the corresponding
ones in Professor Paul’s book. But even where, from
the nature of the case, we had to follow Paul closely,
we have always aimed at supplying further English
examples or at explaining fully the illustrations from
other tongues.</p>

<p>A word should, perhaps, be said as to the joint
authorship. In all cases what the one wrote has been
read by the other, and Mr. Logeman wishes more
especially to acknowledge in this matter his obligations
to Professor Strong for many a correction of sentences
where his style might have betrayed the foreigner. Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler has perused the greater
part of the work, and supplied many apt illustrations.
Several important passages are from his pen. The
authors at the same time have to acknowledge their
gratitude to Mr. R. H. Case, B.A., who has patiently
read the whole work. It was of immense advantage
to them to have the benefit of the observations of a
highly cultured mind, well versed in English and its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
literature, but new to a subject like this, such as
Mr. Case brought to the work. Many improvements
were thus made in various places where he could show
the need of fuller explanation or of a different way of
expressing the matter.</p>

<p>It may perhaps cause some surprise that we
have omitted the introduction, and, unless a word in
explanation of this fact were added, this omission
might seem to imply but slight courtesy to Professor
Paul, or respect for his emphatic statement that he
considers this introduction by no means useless, nay,
an integral and important part of his book.</p>

<p>We do not at all share the opinion of some critics
of Professor Paul’s work, to whom he almost indignantly
refers as having said that this introduction has
no bearing upon the chapters which follow. But we
do consider that the book in this our present form can
be profitably studied without it, and especially that
his introduction is of so general a nature that there
would be no advantage whatever in recasting it; and
that it can be equally well studied, and should be
studied, either in the original or in the translation of
Paul’s own book&mdash;a work of such importance that, as
we would once more insist, we do not wish our book
to supersede it, but rather that our pages should cause
the reader to ‘ask for more’ and peruse the original
work.</p>

<p>The authors feel, of course, quite certain that their
work is not final: they are but too keenly aware that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
they may have overlooked important illustrations which
might be drawn from English, and are quite prepared
to discover that here and there they may have added
sins of commission to such errors of omission. They
will heartily welcome all criticism and all indications of
such imperfections, and if ever the demands for the
work may necessitate a second edition, they hope that
it will be found that they&mdash;in the words of a well-known
author of a well-known book&mdash;have spent their time
since the publication of the First Edition in trying to
find out those things which they ought to have put in
and did not put in, and those things which they did
put in and ought not to have put in.</p>

<span class="medium">ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>It is the province of the Science of Language to
explain, as far as possible, the processes of the
development of Language from its earliest to its latest
stage. The observations made on these processes
would naturally be registered in different <i>historical
grammars</i> of different definite languages; these
grammars would follow the different steps in the
development of each single language from its earliest
traditional origin to its most recent phase. Wider
and more general observations on the processes of
this development would naturally be expressed in a
<i>comparative grammar</i>, whose task would be to examine
and compare the relations between cognate families
of speech, the common origin of which is lost: but
it would in this case be necessary to insist that
the comparisons instituted should only be between
languages in the same stage of development; or that
the same stage of development, in each of the
languages selected for comparison, should be taken
for the purpose.</p>

<p>It is the task of <i>Descriptive Grammar</i> to ascertain
and record the grammatical forms and the conditions
generally of a given linguistic community at a given
time; to register, in fact, all the utterances of any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
individual belonging to such community which might
fall from him without exposing him to the suspicion
of being a foreigner. It will naturally register its
observations in abstractions, such as paradigms and
rules. Now, if we compare the abstractions made at
any given period of a language with those made at
another time, we find that the results are different, and
we say that the language has <i>changed</i> in certain
respects: nay, we may even be able to detect a certain
regularity in these changes; as, for instance, if we note
that in English every <i>th</i> in the third person singular
present indicative of a verb is now replaced by <i>s</i>: but
we gather by such comparisons no information as to
the true nature and origin of these changes. Cause
and effect do not and cannot exist between mere
abstractions: they exist only between real objects and
facts. It is only when we begin to take account of the
psychical and bodily organisms on which language
depends, and to seek for relations of cause and effect
in connection with these, that we are on safe ground.</p>

<p>The true object of the Science of Language, as
distinguished from Descriptive and Comparative
Grammar, is the entirety of the utterances of all individuals
that speak; and the relations of these utterances
to each other. A full history of the development
of language would demand an exact knowledge of
all the groups of sound ever uttered or heard, and
of all the ideas awakened by such sound-groups and
symbolised by them. The impossibility of attaining
to any such knowledge is obvious; it is, however, possible
for us to get a general idea of the play of the
forces at work in the vast and complex series of processes
involved in the development of language. A
part only of these operating forces is cognisable by our
senses. Speaking and hearing are two of the processes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
which can be apprehended; and, again, the ideas,
or pictures, called up by language, and those which,
though unspoken, pass through our consciousness, are
to some extent capable of cognition. But one of the
greatest triumphs of modern psychology is the proof,
due to its agency, of the unconscious activity of the
human mind. All that has once been present to our
consciousness remains as a working factor in unconsciousness.
Power consciously acquired by exercise in
consciousness may be translated into power operating
and manifesting itself unconsciously. The mind forms
from the groups of ideas with which it is stored, psychological
groups, such as sound-groups, sequences of
sounds, sequences of ideas, and syntactical combinations.
Strong and weak verbs, derivatives from the same
root, words fulfilling identical functions, such as the
different parts of speech, associate themselves into
groups; and again the plurals of nouns, their different
cases, their different inflections, and even entire clauses
of similar construction or similar cadence, group themselves
in the same way. These groups arise naturally,
automatically, and unconsciously, and must not be
confused with the categories consciously drawn up
by grammarians; though the two, of course, must frequently
coincide.</p>

<p>These groups must obviously be in a constant
state of change, some growing weaker from the fact
that they are strengthened by no fresh impulse, and
some being strengthened and, it may be, changed by
the accession of new ideas which ally themselves
therewith. It must not be overlooked also that, as
each person’s mind is differently constituted, the groups
of his linguistic ideas will take a development peculiar
to himself; even though the sources whence the groups
take their rise should be identical, yet the elements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
which go to form the groups will be introduced differently
and with different intensity in the case of each
individual.</p>

<p>The action of our physical organs, unaided, would
be unable to bring about the development of language.
The word, when once spoken, disappears and leaves
no traces; psychological activity, and this alone, connects
the pictures of the past with the present. It
must, therefore, be the task of the historian of language
to give as complete an account as possible of the
psychical organisms on which the production of language
depends; and the psychical organism of language
in each individual is the aggregate of more or less
conscious recollections of words, nay, even of entire
phrases, and of their connections with certain ideas,
which is lodged in his mind. It is the business of the
historian of language to watch and examine these
organisms as closely as possible: to describe the elements
of which they are composed, and their connection
with each other. A state or condition of a
language at a particular period could only be described
by one possessed of a full knowledge of the psychical
conditions at a particular time of all the members of
any linguistic community. The more fully such observations
as those referred to above are carried out, and
the greater the number of individuals thus examined,
the more nearly shall we be in a condition to give an
accurate description of a state of language. Without
a rigidly scrupulous examination such as we have
described, it would be impossible to say how much in
the language of any individual is common to all or
most individuals speaking the same language, and how
much is to be set down to individual peculiarity. In
every case it will be found that the standard of the
language governs to some extent the language of every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
individual; but in the case of each individual there
are likewise elements which do not conform to the
standard or normal language, and which are, in fact,
individual peculiarities.</p>

<p>In any case, the observation of a psychical organism
of language is difficult. It cannot, like the physical
side of language, <i>i.e.</i> the sounds actually produced and
even the mode of their production, be directly observed;
for it lies unseen in the mind, and is only known by
its effects.</p>

<p>Of the physical phenomena of linguistic activity,
the acoustic are those which lend themselves most
readily to our observation. We can make the same
individual repeat sounds practically identical as often
as we please; and we can note these with more or less
accuracy in proportion as our own sense of hearing is
exact and developed. But as the transitions between
the different sounds are so infinitely small, it follows
that it must be a matter of extreme difficulty for the
listener to decide whether the sounds are indeed precisely
the same in colour, pitch, etc.; while, again, if it
be desired to reproduce any sound, the process has to
be carried out by orally repeating it and striving to
reproduce it by an appeal to another’s sense of hearing.</p>

<p>We register the sounds of a language by mastering
and registering the movements of the organs of speech
that produce them. Alphabetical symbols are at best
but very imperfect pictures of sound-groups: they are
used inconsistently in most cases: and in any case even
the most perfect phonetic alphabet cannot give a true
and exact picture of the countless sounds in speech&mdash;sounds
which require to be constantly denoted anew in
every language. We can only succeed at all in registering
such sounds, when we are able to closely observe
the sounds uttered by living individuals. But when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
we cannot do this, we must always think of the sounds
which the writing is intended to represent; and the
power so to do demands some acquaintance with
phonetics, and with the relation between writing and
language. Thus a certain special training is necessary
before we can hope to be able to gain any real knowledge
of even the physical manifestations of linguistic
activity.</p>

<p>The psychical factors in linguistic activity lie, like
everything else psychical, unseen in the mind, and can
therefore only be scrutinised by means of examinations
made upon our own minds. In the process of watching
other individuals we can never perceive any other
than physical results, and thus it happens that in order
to acquaint ourselves with the psychical organisms of
language in others, we have to watch as closely as
possible the processes in our own minds, and then to
classify the phenomena which we observe in the case
of others by the analogy of what we observe in our
own. As we both think and speak in the mother-tongue,
our classifications by analogy will be easier
when we have to deal with fellow-countrymen; so too,
for obvious reasons, with the living subject rather
than with what has been committed to writing in the
past.</p>

<p>It will, then, be plain that the observation of any
given state of language is no easy matter, owing to the
manifold and complex way in which groups of ideas
associate themselves in the human mind, and owing to
the incessant progress of hardly perceptible sound-change.
It may easily be gathered that even the most
full and perfect of ordinary grammars are quite unable
to portray the manner in which different ideas and
groups of ideas range and classify themselves. Our
grammatical system can give but the most imperfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
picture of the relationships existing between different
ideas. Certain categories, for instance, are drawn up,
and under one or other of these are ranged words
under the name of certain parts of speech. As a
matter of fact, a large proportion of words is capable of
being used to fulfil the function of several parts of
speech, and in no language is this more obvious than in
English. Again, we are accustomed in grammar to
meet&mdash;even in the case of the Indo-European group
of languages&mdash;with the same grammatical term
employed to express quite different functions, as when
we speak of the Latin <i>future</i>, and call the English
future in “<i>I shall</i>” or “<i>I will</i>” do by the same name.
Again, we are accustomed, in the case of a language
which has passed from the synthetic to the analytic
stage, to employ the same categories, regardless of the
fact that, in the analytical form of the language, new
shades of meaning have found expression as they have
also come into being. Again, we often define the
meaning of words by their etymology, even though the
ordinary speaker may have no knowledge whatever of
that etymology, and a new and very different meaning
may have attached itself to the word.</p>

<p>The comparison of different epochs in the life of any
language will enable us to draw some inferences as to
its condition in the past. Of course, in proportion as
the foreign factors that have made their influence felt
in the regular course of the language are fewer, the
simpler and more satisfactory will be the comparison.
It would be impossible to reconstruct the sounds of
Anglo-Saxon, for instance, from Middle English only;
as it would be necessary to remember that Norman,
Danish, Celtic, and other influences had been busy
with the language between its earlier and later stages.</p>

<p>We now proceed to ask what are the causes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
change in language? And how do these causes
operate? In the first place, they operate in most
instances without the consciousness of the individual.
There are, indeed, a few cases in which we may say
that conscious intention on the part of the individual
is operative, as where a botanist coins a name for
some new variety, and forces it upon all the scientific
men of his circle. But it must be repeated that
changes are for the most part involuntary and unconscious.
It is of the essence of the life of language
to unconsciously select the forms and sounds which
may best serve for conveying the meaning present in
the speaker’s mind. The material existing and forming
the actual stock in trade of any language may very
aptly be looked upon as the survival of the fittest; in
this case, of the <i>material</i> fittest to survive. If we now
proceed to consider the causes of change in language,
we must remember that there is always in language
a certain amount of freedom left to the individual,
which is quite independent of ordinary linguistic development.
As each speaker must have certain
psychical peculiarities, so must he express himself
differently from every other speaker; and if the
sound-producing organs of any given speaker have
any peculiarities, he will exhibit corresponding peculiarities
in the sounds which he utters by their agency.
Again, there are circumstances which must not be
overlooked, like the natural tendency to imitation;
and the further circumstance that all attempts
at imitation must necessarily be imperfect. Again,
each individual is prone to modify the sounds which
he utters, through carelessness and economy of effort
or laziness. Besides all this, we must reckon the
effects produced by such factors as climate, which,
however gradual in their operation, must still ultimately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
leave some effects if only time enough is
allowed. The result of these displacements, if only
the tendency to displacement lasts long enough and
operates in one direction, is a <i>displacement of usage</i>.
The new usage starts from the individual, and, under
favourable circumstances, succeeds in becoming permanent.
There are, however, numerous other tendencies
to displacement likewise constantly occurring
which do not become permanent, because they are not
consistent, and because they do not all run in the
same direction.</p>

<p>It must, then, be the task of the historian of
language to endeavour to settle the relationship
between linguistic usage on the one hand, and
individual linguistic activity on the other; and in
order to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions on this
point, it is necessary to classify, as far as we can, the
different changes of usage which occur in the growth
and development of language. It is, then, his business
to trace the relationship between the different classes
which he has formed, and to remember that his
province is to trace connections where ordinary
grammar draws lines of demarcation, bearing in mind
that the steps which lead from class to class are very
gradual, and that the processes leading up to the
smallest variation of usage are in very few cases due
to a single cause, but are generally very complicated.
The gradual development in the life of language in
general may be best studied in individual languages,
as when we compare the English of Chaucer’s day
with that of our own; and, again, in the relations
of individual languages to each other, as when we
compare Spanish, for instance, with Italian, and note
the different paths taken by these sister-tongues in
their development from Latin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Sound-changes come about in the individual partly
from the tendencies of his own organs of speech, as
when [<i>ii</i>] becomes [<i>ai</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>] and when one sound is
habitually substituted for another, as in the case of the
Russian <i>F</i>eodor for <i>Th</i>eodore, or the similar substitution,
frequent among children, <i>f</i>ing for <i>th</i>ing. They
partly, too, depend upon the influences which each
individual receives from others, as when an endeavour
is made to substitute a significant for an unmeaning
whole, in cases of popular etymology and the like.
To this must be added the possibility of imperfect
audition, and consequently of imperfect reproduction
of sounds. These influences are mostly operative and
easiest of observation at the time that language is
being learnt, <i>i.e.</i> most commonly during the time of
infancy. To watch such processes as a particular
language is being learnt must always be very
instructive for the explanation of variations in the
usages of language in general.</p>

<p>These changes in usage may of course be classified
in various ways, but there is one important point
which should be noted: the processes may either
consist in the creation of what is new or in the disappearance
of what is old; or, lastly, in the replacement
of the old by the new in a single act, which is
the process seen in sound-change. In the case of
word-significations, the processes of change consist
either in the disappearance of the old or in the
appearance of the new. But these processes are in
truth very gradual. A word may be perfectly
intelligible with a certain meaning in one generation,
and in another generation may be obsolete and not
understood: but there will none the less have been an
intervening generation, some members of which understood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the meaning attached to the word or phrase by
the former generation, while some only imperfectly
understood it.</p>

<p>Again, we may classify changes in usage according
to whether sounds or significations are affected. The
sounds change without the signification being altered,
as in the numerous words in Chaucer which as yet
clearly retained their French pronunciation. Again,
the signification is affected without any change affecting
the sound, as in the case of metaphorical uses of a
word, such as <i>a crane</i>, used alike for the bird and the
lifting machine; etc. Thus it is that we arrive at the
two classes of change: sound-change and change in
signification; not that the two kinds are mutually exclusive&mdash;they
may both occur together, as in our <i>owe</i>,
from A.S. <i>âgan</i>, to possess. But the two kinds of
change are independent in their origin and their development;
neither is caused by the other.</p>

<p>There is, however, an important class of cases in
which Sound and Meaning develop simultaneously;
these are the original creations of language; and we
must suppose the entire development of language to
rest upon this primitive combination. We must conceive
the original utterances in language to have been
the imitation of various natural cries and sounds, aided
and interpreted by gesticulation. Then comes a stage
in which the sound-groups already existing in language
develop on the basis of this original creation. They
develop in this way mainly by the influence of analogy,
which is itself an imitative faculty and plays a larger
part where sound and signification are united than in
the department of pure sound. The principles of which
we have spoken must be held applicable to all languages
at all stages of their development. When once language
had originated, it must have developed solely in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
way we have indicated. The differences between early
and later stages of language are merely differences of
degree and not of kind.</p>

<p>It must also be noticed that we must not sharply
separate the grammatical and the logical relations of
language, as if they were in no way connected. Grammatical
rules are simply convenient descriptions of the
most ordinary and striking ways in which a language
expresses itself at a particular time. But the groups
of ideas in the mind of a speaker are constantly forming
themselves anew, and finding expression in forms which
do not tally with actual and received linguistic expression,
and, as they change, give rise to so-called irregularities
of grammar. The philologist must therefore
discard neither the linguistic processes which are
described and registered by grammar, nor the psychical
ones which manifest themselves in speaking and hearing,
but are not represented in linguistic expression,
and yet are always operative in the direction of change
in Language.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="medium">ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>The most elementary study of Comparative Philology
teaches us that from a language which, in all essentials,
may be considered one uniform tongue, there have
frequently sprung several others; and that these, in
their turn, have parted into new dialects or distinct
languages. This process has been usually compared
to that which we see operative in the growth
and development of organic nature; and the relationship
between various languages has often been expressed
by the terms applicable to the human family.
Latin, for instance, is called the <i>parent</i> of French,
Spanish, Portuguese, and the other Romance dialects;
English and Dutch are called <i>sister</i>-tongues, while the
last-named pair may be called <i>cousins</i> of German.</p>

<p>The comparison implied by such use of these terms
is in the main correct; but it would be more exact to
illustrate the relationship between languages from the
language of Botany: we might consider the language
of each individual speaker as the parallel of the individual
plant, and compare the various dialects,
languages, and families of languages, to the varieties,
species, and classes of the vegetable kingdom. Even
then our simile is but partially applicable, and a careful
consideration of how far it holds good, and where and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
when it becomes misleading, will be found instructive
to a student of language.</p>

<p>It is now an admitted truth in Zoology as well as in
Botany that nothing but the individual plant or animal
has any real existence, and that all our species or
classes are merely convenient and useful, but always
arbitrary, abstractions. The difference between two
primroses is not as great as that between a primrose
and, <i>e.g.</i>, a daisy, it is true; but the differences between
these pairs are merely differences in degree, and not
in kind. When we classify or arrange in groups, we
select some characteristic and thereby give it a certain
pre-eminence over others. All individuals that possess
this characteristic are accordingly ranged upon one
side, and all that do not possess it are ranged upon
the other. If the characteristic has been well chosen,
our classification will be rational, but will none the less
remain arbitrary; and very often&mdash;nay, nearly always&mdash;the
choice of any other quality or characteristic as
the principle of classification will be found to involve a
different grouping.</p>

<p>It is the same with language. Strictly speaking,
there exist as many distinct languages as there are
individual speakers. These millions of languages,
however, fall naturally into groups, whose component
individual parts differ but very little from one another,
though no two of them are exactly alike. Now, in
order to decide whether the language of any one
individual belongs to some particular group, we must
select one or more particular characteristics, by which
to test its claim; and, our selection made, we shall often
find ourselves excluding some language whose inclusion
would have resulted from any other test than the one
selected. The difficulty is much increased when we
come to range our groups into dialects, or to classify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the latter among or around languages (using that term
again in its conventional sense); and, again, to arrange
languages into families.</p>

<p>At no single moment do we find all the individuals
of any nation, community, or group of human beings,
speaking the same language in the strict sense of the
expression; and thus, if we say that a language has
broken up or separated into several dialects or into
various new languages, we give a very inadequate
description of what has really happened. It would be
truer to state that amongst any given group of individual
languages, the difference, once slight, between its various
members has grown to such an extent that we can
no longer conveniently class these members together.</p>

<p>In the next place, our comparison will also hold
good in the following point. The nature and development
of the individual animal depends upon two things&mdash;descent
and environment. Animals, the offspring
of similar parents, resemble one another in all essentials:
they are, however, not absolutely alike, and
their individual peculiarities and development depend
largely on surroundings, such as climate, food, etc.,&mdash;influences
which, as might be expected, make themselves
felt most strongly in infancy.</p>

<p>Again, it is the same in language. Speech is acquired
by imitation, and those who speak to the child
may be considered its linguistic parents. The special
bodily and mental idiosyncrasies of the child take the
place of the accidental surroundings to which reference
has already been made. No two children hear
precisely the same words spoken by the very same
persons and exactly the same number of times; no
two parents and no two children are, in mind and body,
exactly alike. From the beginning there is a difference,
small though it may be, between the linguistic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
surroundings of any two individuals; and the development
depends upon personal peculiarities, which, from
a linguistic point of view, may be called accidental.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that our attention is engaged at the
very outset of our linguistic inquiry, not merely by
the fact that differences arise in the language of individuals,
but more especially by the question why these
differences are not even greater and more rapid
in their development than they prove to be. We
must seek an explanation not merely of the nature
of the forces tending to differentiate the individual
languages, but also of those which counteract such
forces, and whose influence is exerted towards uniformity
and the conservation of such unity as exists.</p>

<p>Yet if our comparison be sufficiently correct in two
such important points, we must not forget that in one
point at least there is an essential difference between
the origin of species in the animal world and the
differentiation of languages.</p>

<p>We saw that with descent in the animal world we
must compare <i>linguistic</i> descent, which latter term
implies that a child’s language is acquired by imitation
from the speakers surrounding him. The language of
the community in which the child grows up is the
parent of his speech. Now, it is evident that in the
animal world the influence of descent, powerful factor
though it be, is still limited, inasmuch as the <i>direct</i>
effect of the parent’s influence ceases at a fixed point.
In language, on the other hand, the influence of the
<i>linguistic</i> parent is permanently at work: strongest
during infancy, it diminishes in force indeed, but never
entirely ceases to make itself felt. Again, the animal
owes its birth to a single pair only, while in language
an indefinite number of speakers co-operate to produce
the new individual. Moreover, as soon as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
child acquires any speech at all, it becomes in its turn
a member of the community and affects the language
of others. Its speech is consciously or unconsciously
imitated by those from whom it learned and is still
learning; and thus, in language, parents may be said
to become the children of their own offspring.</p>

<p>Differentiation of language is, of course, impossible
unless usage alters; but it would be incorrect to conclude
that differentiation must necessarily be greater
as the variation in usage is more violent. There is
no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> reason why a large group of individuals,
who at any given moment speak what may be considered
to be <i>one and the same</i> language, should not
alter their usage all in the same manner. Yet, if we
remember that each individual has his own peculiarities,
and that, while each acquires his speech by
imitating others, such imitation is never perfect, we
shall readily understand that language must change
from generation to generation, even were other causes
not present to promote such changes; and, in fact,
that differences will and must arise. Alteration and
differentiation are unavoidable; and it is intercourse
between the members of a community or a nation
which can alone keep these within bounds. The
alterative forces are more free to exert their influence
in proportion as such intercourse is restricted.</p>

<p>If we could imagine a large country where the
intercourse between the inhabitants was of perfectly
equal intensity throughout, we might expect to find
the language of each individual differing but imperceptibly
from the respective languages of his neighbours;
and, though the tongues spoken at opposite
extremities might show a wide divergence, it would
be impossible to arrange the individual varieties into
dialectical groups; for the speech of each man would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
be some intermediate stage between the individual
tongues on either side. But such equal intensity of
intercourse exists nowhere over any considerable area.
Geographical, political, commercial influences, separately
or combined, erect barriers or overcome them;
and peculiarities of speech which, arising at one place,
spread over others, are yet confined within certain
limits. These peculiarities, then, will clearly distinguish
those dialects of individuals which partake
of them from such as do not; and consequently we
shall have distinct limits for grouping the dialects
spoken by separate individuals into those spoken by
separate districts&mdash;that is to say, into what is most
commonly understood when we speak of ‘dialects.’</p>

<p>All would now be simple and easy if lines of demarcation
thus arrived at were found to coincide with
whatever peculiarities or characteristics we happened
to choose for our criteria. But the fact is that groups
which would be classed together in view of some
special points of resemblance will fall asunder when
other points are considered as essential characteristics;
for the spread of characteristics derived from intercourse
with one district must frequently be checked
and thwarted by intercourse with another district that
does not share the same tendency.</p>

<p>Thus, if we make use of the letter <i>a</i> to indicate a
group of individuals speaking a tongue essentially
identical, employing <i>b</i> for another such group, <i>c</i> for a
third, and so on, then <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> may very possibly
correspond in usage or pronunciation in some point, <i>x</i>,
in which both may differ from <i>c</i>, while <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, but
not <i>b</i>, will be found to agree in <i>y</i>. In yet a third
point, <i>z</i>, in which they both differ from <i>a</i>, etc., <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
may agree; whilst <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and other groups may very
well have points, <i>w</i>, <i>t</i>, etc., in common with one another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
and with <i>d</i> or <i>e</i>, and in these same points will differ
from <i>f</i>. On the other hand, <i>f</i> may agree in some other
points with <i>a</i>, in some with <i>b</i>, in some with <i>c</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell further on this. We
see plainly that as different alterations have a different
extent and different lines of demarcation, the crossings
of groups and resemblances may be expected to become
of infinite complexity.</p>

<p>But if, further, we suppose the differentiation between
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> to be already so great that we may
regard these as separate dialects, yet it is by no means
impossible that a tendency to some alteration should
make itself felt in each of them, or that, having arisen
in one, the peculiarity should spread over all. It
follows from this consideration that any peculiarity
shared by all or many dialects of a language is not
necessarily older than one which characterises only a
few, though, of course, that such will be the case is
the natural assumption.</p>

<p>Nor are the most strongly marked characteristics,
by whose means we now distinguish existing dialects,
and according to which we range them into groups,
necessarily older than those which we overlook in
deciding these mutual relationships. To instance this,
we may refer to the various Teutonic dialects, which
undoubtedly had many marked differences long before
the process of sound-shifting began. It was some
time in or near the seventh century <small>A.D.</small> when some
of these dialects commenced to substitute <i>p</i> for <i>b</i>, <i>t</i> for
<i>d</i>, <i>k</i> for <i>g</i>; <i>t</i> became <i>ts</i> (<i>z</i>), <i>k</i> became <i>h</i>, <i>p</i> became <i>f</i> or
<i>pf</i>, and in some cases <i>b</i> and <i>g</i> were substituted for
the sonant fricatives <i>v</i> and <i>g</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> This change or sound-shifting
was in progress during something like two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
centuries, and it is according to the extent of their
participation in this that we classify the various dialects
as High German, Middle German, and Low German,
respectively. We consequently class as Low German
three dialects which otherwise present very strongly
marked differences: the Frisian, the Saxon, and in part
the Franconian, the case of which last is especially
instructive.</p>

<p>The Franconian dialect did not as a whole participate
in the changes to which we have alluded above.
Only the more southern part of the Franconian tribe
adopted the sound-shifting, in common with other
southern tribes which spoke distinctly different dialects.
Consequently, adhering to our above-mentioned principle
of classification, we must class the so-called <i>Low</i>
Franconian in a group totally distinct from that in
which the <i>High</i> Franconian must be placed, notwithstanding
the fact that in other respects these dialects
have preserved many important resemblances.</p>

<p>It would also be incorrect to regard dialects which
have become more strongly differentiated than others
as having necessarily become so at an earlier date.
The widest divergence is not necessarily the oldest, for
circumstances may arise to facilitate the widening of a
recent breach, as they may, on the other hand, arise
to prevent a slight divergence of long standing from
becoming a gap of importance. If two groups, <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>, are differentiated, and yet keep up sufficient intercourse,
they may very well remain similar, though not
equal, during a very long period; while a subdivision
of <i>a</i>, which circumstances only affecting a minority in
that group have separated later, may develop a rapidly
increasing divergence between its small community on
the one hand, and the remaining members of <i>a</i> together
with the whole of <i>b</i> on the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>One more lesson resulting from the foregoing consideration
is the following. It is too often assumed as
a matter of course that the speech of districts lying
between others that possess strongly differentiated
languages is the result of the contact and commixture
of the two latter. Such possibility is indeed not
denied; it, in fact, often occurs; but the alternative
supposition that the mixture is a survival of some
intermediate dialect is equally possible, and must not
be forgotten.</p>

<p>It is clear that what we now call languages are
merely further developments of dialects; but here
once more we may easily err by assuming too much.
If we find two distinct languages, it does not necessarily
follow that they have passed through a stage in
which they were two dialects, distinct indeed, but
differing to a less extent than at present. Indicating
dialects by <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and languages by <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>,
we must not conclude, on meeting with the two latter,
that <i>A</i> must have inevitably originated from <i>a</i>, and <i>B</i>
from <i>b</i>. It is quite possible that both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> may
have arisen from (say) <i>a</i> alone; and of this possibility
Anglo-Saxon and its descendant Modern English
furnish a clear instance.</p>

<p>The dialect spoken by the invaders differed, if at
all, in a very slight degree from the Frisian (<i>a</i>),
which followed a regular course of development in its
ancestral home. But the language of the invaders
(which, in view of its identity or close resemblance
with the Frisian, we may also call <i>a</i>) had in the
British Islands a different history and a different
development. It was rapidly differentiated, and one
of its dialects became a literary language, distinct in
every point from its sister-tongue. Thus the modern
representative of Frisian (<i>A</i>), and our present literary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
English (<i>B</i>) are found to have sprung from one source
(<i>a</i>) alone.</p>

<p>The consideration of this case leads us to our next
point. In all the foregoing cases we presupposed
that the speakers of the individual language or of the
group-languages were on the whole stationary. We
need not here indicate at length the effect upon a
community of its migration into regions where other
languages are prevalent. The result is commonly a
mixed language: and the subject of so-called mixed
languages we reserve for another chapter: here we
need only remind the student that by such migrations
the connection of the language of the emigrants with
that of other communities of similar speech is loosened,
and the action of differentiating forces, which thus
acquire free and unrestricted play, must necessarily be
augmented.</p>

<p>The criterion for distinction of dialects among a
community of individual languages is, and must be,
their phonetic character. Vocabulary and syntax are
easily and generally maintained, or, if anything new
arises, it may possibly spread over wide areas; but
differences of pronunciation and peculiarities of
utterance do not necessarily result from the borrowing
of new terms.</p>

<p>For instance: a community which pronounces <i>a</i> of
<i>father</i> as <i>aw</i> (<i>i.e.</i> like <i>a</i> in <i>all</i>) will do so even when
borrowing a word from some dialect in which the pure
<i>a</i> is usual.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we must not omit to combat an error
too often repeated in books on language which enjoy
a reputation otherwise well-deserved. It is a common
notion that the tendency to differentiation is, as
civilisation advances, replaced by one towards unification;
in proof of which we are reminded of the one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
uniform literary language which, among the educated
members of a nation, replaces the various provincial
dialects. But this literary language is by no means a
regular and natural development of the pre-existing
dialects.</p>

<p><i>One</i> of these, favoured by circumstances political
or literary, obtains a supremacy which causes its
adoption by those who would otherwise ignore it
and continue to speak the dialects of their own
provinces, counties, or districts. Hence it is in a
certain sense a foreign tongue to them, and though in
course of time it may come to replace the indigenous
dialect of any district, so that scarcely a trace of the
latter remains, it would be misleading to say that this
dialect has developed into a language before which it
has in reality disappeared.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="medium">ON SOUND-CHANGE.</span></h2>

<p>Language is in a constant state of change; and the
changes to which it is subject fall under two very
different heads. In the first place, new words find
their way into a language, whilst existing words
become obsolete and drop out of existence: and,
secondly, existing words remain, but gradually alter
their pronunciation. It is the second of these
phenomena which we have to study in this chapter;
and a clear idea of its nature, origin, and progress is
indispensable to any real knowledge of philology.</p>

<p>To gain this idea we must carefully consider the
processes which occur when we speak. We have to
take note of no less than five elements, all of which
are present each time that we utter a sound, and these
should be carefully distinguished.</p>

<p>In the first place, whether we break silence and
begin to speak, or proceed in the course of speaking to
any particular sound, our vocal organs must move
towards a certain position, in which they must remain
during the time of the utterance of the sound. This
is equally true whether they are set in motion
after a period of rest, or after a position rendered
necessary by their utterance of some other sound.
Let us take, for instance, the sound which in the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
<i>father</i> we represent by the letter <i>a</i>. In pronouncing
this <small>WORD</small> we <small>BEGIN</small> by putting our lips, tongue, vocal
chords, etc., all in such a position that, on the breath
passing through them or coming into contact with
them, the sound represented by <i>f</i> is produced; and
as long as the vocal organs remain in that position,
nothing but <i>f</i> can be pronounced. In order, then, to
pronounce the <i>a</i> sound, we must alter the position of
our vocal organs: our vocal chords must be approximated,
our lips relaxed, our mouth opened wider, until
the <i>a</i> position is attained. It is clear that the course
which we take to reach our goal depends not merely
upon the position of that goal, but likewise upon the
point whence we start to reach it. Hence the course
whereby we reach this <i>a</i> position will vary constantly
and considerably, seeing that in our utterance of the
<i>a</i> sound we can and do cause many other sounds to
precede it. But all these movements agree in one
respect, that they terminate in a certain position, which
we maintain as long as the <i>a</i> sound lasts.</p>

<p>Secondly, we must notice that this position is
maintained only by a certain balance of the tension in
the various muscles of our tongue, throat, lips, etc.;
and this tension, though we may not indeed be
conscious of it, <i>we feel</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, <i>we hear</i>, more or less exactly, the sound
which we produce.</p>

<p>Fourthly, this feeling and this sound, like every
physical occurrence in which we actively or passively
participate, leave behind them in our mind a certain
impression. This impression, though it may indeed
disappear and sink beneath the level of consciousness,
remains nevertheless existent, is strengthened by
repetition, and can, under certain conditions, be again
recalled to consciousness. We consequently come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
gradually to acquire a permanent mental impression
of both feeling and sound. There is formed in our
mind what we may call the memory-picture of the
<i>position</i>; and</p>

<p>Fifthly, there is likewise formed ‘a memory-picture’
of the <i>sound</i>.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that of these five ‘elements’
only the last two are permanent, and that they, and
they only, are psychical. In every individual case of
sound-utterance, all that is <i>physical</i> is momentary and
transitory. We abandon the position; the corresponding
tensions make way for others; the sound dies
away: but the memory-pictures alike of position and
sound remain in our mind. There is no physical connection
between our utterances of the ‘same’ sound,
or word, or phrase; there is only a psychical connection:
and this reposes upon the two elements which
we have already called the memory-pictures of sound
and position respectively.</p>

<p>A word must be added on the nature of the association
existing between these two. This association,
however intimate it may be, is <i>external</i> only; there is
no necessary <i>psychical</i> connection between any sensation
of vibration in our organs of hearing and any
other sensation of tension in the muscles of our vocal
organs. If we gained the first-named sensation again
and again from hearing others speak, yet we should
still be unable to imitate them at once, even though,
for whatever reason, we had set our vocal organs
repeatedly in the same position. But the fact that
when we ourselves utter a sound we also hear it,
associates the physical sensations of sound with those
of position, and this invariably; and it thus happens
that the respective memory-pictures of the two are
left closely associated in our mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>When we speak of these movement- and sound-pictures
as lingering or as existing in our memories,
it is not implied that we are necessarily conscious of
their existence. On the contrary, the speaker, under
ordinary circumstances, is wholly unconscious of them:
nor has he anything like a clear notion of the various
elements of sound which together make up the spoken
word, or it may be the sentence, which he utters. It
would seem as though the art of writing and spelling,
which presupposes some analysis of the sound of
words, proved that the speaker, if capable of spelling
and writing, must have at least some notion of those
elements. But very little consideration will suffice to
prove the contrary. In the first place, strictly speaking,
it is absolutely impossible to denote in writing all
the various elements of sound which combine to form
any word or sentence. A word, however correctly
and grammatically spelt, does not consist merely of
those sounds which we symbolise in our writing. In
reality it consists&mdash;or at least the syllable consists&mdash;of
an <i>unbroken</i> series of successive sounds or articulations,
and of this series, even if we spell ‘phonetically,’ our
letters represent at best no more than the most clearly
distinguished points; whereas, between these sounds
so symbolised by our letters, there lie an indefinite
number of transition sounds, of which no writer or
speller takes any notice.</p>

<p>The above is true in the case of languages like
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and German, where the
spelling is more or less consistent: much more is it
true in the case of English or French, with their
irrational and puzzling inconsistencies. A child which
learns that it must represent the sound of the word
<i>but</i> by letters to be called respectively bee-you-tea, or
the word <i>though</i> by letters nick-named tea-aitch-o-you-gee-aitch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
does not receive a lesson in separating the
sound-group represented by the letters <i>but</i> into its
three, or the sound-group represented by <i>though</i> into
its two (or three) elements.</p>

<p>Even in the more correctly spelt languages, there
are numerous discrepancies between the spoken and
written word, which, until they are pointed out to him,
escape the attention of the native speaker or writer.
In English, some instances may be here considered.
Not a few English people are quite surprised when
they are informed that they have two distinct ways of
pronouncing <i>th</i>, or of pronouncing <i>x</i>: the <i>th</i> ‘hard,’
as in <i>thin</i>, and ‘soft,’ as in <i>then</i>; the <i>x</i> like <i>ks</i>, as in
<i>execution</i> (eksekyushion), and like <i>gz</i>, as in <i>executive</i>
(egzekyutiv), <i>exact</i> (egzakt), <i>example</i> (egzampl). And
there are fewer still who have ever noticed that in
<i>income</i> many pronounce no <i>n</i> at all, but the same
guttural and nasal sound as terminates <i>king</i>.</p>

<p><i>Can</i> is frequently pronounced <i>c<sup>h</sup>an</i>, with a distinct
<i>h</i> sound after the <i>c</i>, without the speaker being aware of
it; and the same holds good of similar words. Again,
none but the trained observer knows that the <i>k</i> in <i>keen</i>
is pronounced differently (more to the front of the
mouth) from the <i>k</i> (represented by <i>c</i>) in <i>cool</i>; but the
fact that perhaps more than all excites incredulous
wonder is that the sound <i>i</i> is no vowel, but a diphthong,
as may be proved by dwelling on it. The speakers to
whom these facts are new may nevertheless all be
perfectly correct speakers: no doubt they pronounce
the elements of the word; but they have probably
never paid any attention to the nature of these elements,
or at least have not begun to do so till long after the
utterance became habitual and natural.</p>

<p>If, then, we speak without consciousness of the
separate <i>sounds</i>, much more are we completely unconscious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of the <i>movements</i> of our vocal organs. It is only
very recently that these movements have been carefully
investigated, and the results of the science of
phonetics are in very many respects as yet <i>sub judice</i>,
while even the most superficial knowledge of the subject
can only be attained by a conscious and careful
effort of attention, and by the exercise of much patience
in the observation of our precise actions when speaking.
It is only the trained observer who can at all follow
these movements as he makes them, and even <i>he</i> does
not so follow them generally, but thinks of the sense
of his words as he speaks, and not of the way in which
they are produced.</p>

<p>Moreover, even assuming that the speaker enjoyed
a far higher degree of consciousness, both of
phonetic elements and of phonetic movement while he
is <i>acquiring</i> the faculty of speech, it would none the
less remain true that in the ordinary course of word-utterance
these facts remain outside the speaker’s
consciousness. A precisely parallel instance can be
observed in the case of a pupil learning to play the
piano or violin. At first every movement he makes is
the result of a separate and conscious act of volition;
but soon practice, the repetition of conscious action, so
much facilitates the playing of scales, arpeggios, etc.,
that the rapidity of their execution quite precludes all
possibility of the bestowal of separate thought, even of
the shortest duration, upon each individual note in succession.
It is necessary at the outset to insist on this
fact of the speaker’s unconsciousness, both of the
elements of sound which make up the word, and of the
movements of his vocal organs; for, once fully grasped,
it will guard against an error which is too prevalent,
viz. that sound-change is the result of conscious volition
in those who speak.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>But though the movements necessary for production
of sounds are performed unconsciously, they are by no
means beyond control; to illustrate which fact we may
once more recur to the parallel instance of the piano-player.
Like him, the speaker controls his work by
listening to its result: but the player strikes either the
right note or the wrong, and, unlike him, the speaker
may vary his utterance in one direction or another
without serious error; he is not considered to make a
<small>MISTAKE</small> unless the difference between his present
utterance and that which is usual exceeds a certain
limit. In this respect, the violin-player resembles the
speaker more closely. They both appeal to their sense
of hearing in order to decide on the correctness or
otherwise of the sound produced, and the control they
can exercise over that sound is exactly proportional to
their delicacy of ear. Up to certain limits, the variations
are too small to be perceived by the ear, but
beyond these, control becomes possible. The slight
differences in pronunciation or sound do not yet,
however, necessarily expose the speaker (or player) to
the charge of incorrect utterance (or performance), and
consequently, though he perceives the change, he pays
little or no attention to it. He only then corrects himself
or guards against repeating the ‘mistake,’ when
the change in sound passes those limits which cannot
be transgressed without detriment to what in music we
term ‘harmony,’ or what in language we term ‘correctness
of utterance.’ It commonly happens that these
limits are wider than the limits of perception referred
to above, more especially in the case of the speaker.
A wider licence is accorded to the term ‘correctness’
in speech than is accorded to it in harmony.</p>

<p>While, then, control is theoretically and practically
limited, the possibility of variation is unlimited. Take,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
for instance, the case of the vowels. All the possible
sounds and variations from <i>u</i> (pronounced as <i>oo</i> in <i>cool</i>)
to <i>i</i> (= <i>ee</i> in <i>feel</i>) may be said to form one uninterrupted
series. In this series we distinguish only some of the
most important varieties. When we pronounce <i>u</i>, the
lips are rounded, and the tongue is drawn back and
raised at the back of the mouth: if we pass from <i>u</i> to
<i>i</i>, the lips are unrounded, and assume the shape of
a narrow and much elongated ellipse, while the tongue
is pushed forward with its back depressed and the fore-part
(the blade) raised. While this change is going
on, the mouth <i>never</i> assumes a position with which we
could not produce some vowel or other, but the difference
in acoustic quality between any two ‘neighbouring’
vowels would not always be such that we should
regard them as distinct or different sounds. On our
way from <i>u</i> to <i>i</i>, we pass through the positions for the
<i>o</i> (<i>oa</i>) in <i>coal</i>, the <i>ŏ</i> in <i>god</i>, the <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>, the <i>ĕ</i>
in <i>net</i>, the <i>e</i> (<i>a</i>) in <i>hare</i>, the <i>ĭ</i> in <i>pit</i>; but between
these there lie an indefinite number of possible shades
of sound, and every one knows how differently various
speakers of the same community pronounce what we
call the same vowel. So, too, we need but little attention
to notice distinct occasional variations, at different
moments, in the same speaker. If, then, one and the
same speaker often <i>perceptibly</i> (though unintentionally)
varies his pronunciation, we may be perfectly sure that
his mode of utterance will vary at different times within
those limits where the divergence&mdash;though existing&mdash;is
not noticed. As with the vowels, so it is, though
not so completely, with many consonants and series of
consonants. The student who is unacquainted with
phonetics should pronounce <i>cool</i> and <i>keen</i> one after the
other, or better still <i>coo</i> and <i>kee</i>, getting rid of the final
consonants. He will have no difficulty in noticing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
difference between the two <i>k</i> sounds, the first of which
requires a much more backward position than the
second for its pronunciation. After a little practice,
he will be able to pronounce the first (back) <i>k</i> with the
<i>ee</i> vowel, and the second (forward, palatal) <i>k</i> with <i>oo</i>.
Now, between these two sounds of <i>k</i> there is a whole
series of intermediate ones, and, if this series be
followed in the direction of the palatal <i>k</i> and then
continued beyond it, we soon reach the articulation of
the palatals proper, and pass, without any appreciable
gap, to the linguo-dentals: first to the <i>t</i> which, in
words like the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i>, sounds so much like <i>q</i>
in the form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">méquier</i> (as the French Canadians actually
pronounce it); and next to our own <i>t</i>, and to the usual
French <i>t</i>, which is pronounced more to the front with
the tip of the tongue against the roots of the teeth.</p>

<p>Similarly, because perfect though slight closure is
not remote from extreme narrowing, we can pass in a
practically unbroken series from energetic <i>p</i> to laxly
uttered <i>f</i>, from <i>k</i> to the guttural fricative of German
<i>ach</i>&mdash;a sound which English, in its modern form, no
longer possesses,&mdash;etc.</p>

<p>As we noticed in the instance of <i>k</i>, and as every
one more easily perceives in the case of the vowels,
two sounds essentially different in articulation and in
acoustic character are often, in daily speech, accepted
as identical, more especially where the difference is
not great enough, or is not of a nature to cause ambiguity
of meaning. If, for instance, there existed words
in the English language alike in all respects but that
the one began with the <i>k</i> of <i>cool</i> and the other with
the <i>k</i> of <i>keen</i>, and if these words had different meanings,
every Englishman would be aware of the existence
of two sounds, which he would most likely
indicate by two different letter-signs. As it is, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
difference between the two remains unnoticed, and the
choice between them depends upon the vowel which
follows. If, then, in the ordinary course of speaking,
a ‘back’ <i>k</i> is pronounced a little more forward, or a
palatal <i>k</i> more to the back, no notice will be taken of
it, unless the variation oversteps a certain limit and, as
a consequence, the unusual articulation sounds strange.
Similarly, for the formation of <i>t</i>, the position of the
tongue may be varied to a very great extent, and yet,
though something unusual in the sound <small>MAY</small> be apprehended,
the result will always be perceived as a <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>We must now once more emphasise the fact that
the memory-picture of the sound, and the (unconscious)
memory-picture of the movement and position,
and these two alone, connect the various utterances of
any sound or sound-group, and decide its character,
and the appreciation of speaker and hearer to its
correctness.</p>

<p>These memory-pictures and their nature and growth
are therefore of the highest importance. They are
the results of <i>all</i> preceding cases of utterance, <i>of which,
however, the last always has the greatest influence</i>.
Every variation in pronunciation entails a variation in
the memory-picture; and this, small as may be the
change, is cumulative and permanent, unless the different
deviations happen to balance one another
exactly. Now, in the main this will be the case when
the speaker finds himself amid his usual surroundings,
and where no external causes co-operate to impel his
deviations into one direction rather than into another:
but let us suppose him transferred to another community,
and brought in contact with a certain pronunciation
habitual there and novel to him. His
memory-picture of the <small>SOUND</small> is made up of his own
pronunciation <i>and</i> of what he hears from others. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
first the new pronunciation strikes him as new, and
<i>two</i> pictures stand side by side in his mind. If, however,
the difference be not too great, these soon blend,
and, the former one fading while the other constantly
gains in force, his pronunciation becomes influenced
without his own knowledge; he pronounces more and
more like the surrounding speakers, and every time he
does so his memory-picture of <small>POSITION</small> gets slightly
altered (always in the same direction) until nothing but
conscious effort of memory or renewed intercourse
with former surroundings can recall the one thus lost.</p>

<p>The same thing happens essentially and effectually,
though the change is slower and less violent, where
external causes favour deviation in any special direction
amongst an entire community. As far as the nature
of the effect goes, it can make no difference whether
we consider the case of a man entering a new community
to find there a pronunciation which differs from
his own, or that of an entire community which alters
its existing pronunciation. But the process will go on
much more slowly in the latter case, since it has to
operate in a number of individuals, and the steps by
which each of them proceeds are in ordinary cases
imperceptibly small.</p>

<p>Of all causes which may tend to alter our pronunciation
in any special direction, facility of utterance
is the most conspicuous and the most easily understood.
There are, in all probability indeed, several others:
climate, habits of diet, etc., all <i>seem</i> to have some
effect, but no one has as yet been able to explain how
they operate. Even ease of pronunciation is not yet
thoroughly understood in all its bearings. We must
not forget that ease is something essentially subjective,
and that the memory-pictures of movement and sound
and the attempt at correct reproduction of the usual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
movement and sound are the main factors, while the
striving after facility of utterance is a very subordinate
one.</p>

<p>Yet there is no doubt whatever that in a number
of instances the new pronunciation is easier than its
predecessor: we now say <i>last</i> instead of <i>latst</i>, examples
of which earlier form may be found in the Ormulum, for
instance. Similarly, <i>best</i> is easier than <i>betst</i>, <i>impossible</i>
than <i>inpossible</i>; and we may refer also to the numerous
words still written with a <i>gh</i> which is no longer
pronounced. In the word <i>knight</i>, the <i>k</i> was formerly
sounded before the <i>n</i>, and the <i>gh</i> represents a sound
which may still be heard in the German word <i>knecht</i>;
and, in fact, all spellings like <i>know</i>, <i>gnat</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>though</i>,
etc., with their numerous mute letters, represent older
and undoubtedly more laborious pronunciations. That
all these sounds have been dropped has unquestionably
facilitated the utterance of the words, and there is a
similar gain of ease in all the well-known instances of
complete or partial assimilation in all languages. So in
Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">otto</i> for Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octo</i>, Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accendo</i> for <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adcendo</i>,
etc. When, however, we come to estimate the comparative
facility of separate single sounds, or even
many combinations, we find ourselves as yet without
any certainty of result or fixed standard. Much that
has been advanced is individual and subjective: all
depends on practice; and this practice we acquire at
an age when we are as yet wholly unable to form or
pronounce an opinion on any question. In fact, most
of our facility of speech comes to us in infancy.</p>

<p>But whatever the cause, we now understand that
the memory-picture of movement and position is shifting
and unstable in its very nature. Unless the
majority of pronunciations around us all alter in the
same direction, the <i>sound</i>-picture does not alter, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
exerts a retarding control upon the rapidity with which
our <i>position</i>-picture, and therewith our own pronunciation,
might otherwise do so. Here, however, we
must draw attention to the fact that we spoke of the
majority of <i>pronunciations</i> around us and not of
speakers. For our sound-picture the number of persons
from whom we hear a word is immaterial; it is
the number of times we hear it pronounced that is
alone of importance.</p>

<p>All that we have hitherto said has had reference to
changes of pronunciation in <i>the same speaker</i>, and in
this case alone can we speak of alteration or change in
the strict sense of the word. But when we say that ‘a
language has altered,’ we use the term in a wider sense,
and include the case when one generation is found to
use a new pronunciation in place of one current at a
former time; when, in fact, it would be strictly correct
to say that an old pronunciation has died out, and that
the new one&mdash;created instead&mdash;differs more or less
from that which was its model.</p>

<p>A child, in learning to speak, attempts to imitate
the sound it hears; and, as long as the resulting
imitation <i>sounds</i> sufficiently correct, any small peculiarity
of pronunciation is generally overlooked. In
such a case, therefore, the child acquires a movement
or position-picture which at once materially differs
from that of the former generation. We all know by
experience that sounds are difficult to ‘catch,’ and
we must remember that the vocal organs may undergo
certain variations in position without producing a
correspondingly large difference in acoustic effect;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
and further, that any sound produced by a particular
position of the vocal organs has a tendency to change
in a different direction and at a different rate from the
course which would seem natural to the same sound if
it had been produced by a different position of the
vocal organs.</p>

<p>If, then, we speak a word to a child, and if the
child utters it (<i>a</i>) with a slightly altered pronunciation,
and (<i>b</i>) with an articulation which differs from that
which <small>WE</small> should naturally employ to produce the
pronunciation which the child gives to the word, then
two comparatively important steps upon the path of
change have already been taken. And thus it is clear
that, though changes in language are constantly and
imperceptibly occurring throughout the whole life of
the individual speaker, yet their rise is most likely and
their progress is most rapid at the time when language
is transferred from one generation to another.</p>

<p>The above, however, will not explain all the changes
which words have undergone. There are some which
have hitherto resisted any other explanation than this:
they appear as the results of repeated errors of utterance,
which errors, owing to particular circumstances
attending each case, must have been committed by
several or by most of the speakers of the same
linguistic community. Such are&mdash;(1) Metathesis, <i>i.e.</i>
where two sounds in the same word reciprocally
change their positions, whether they are (<i>a</i>) contiguous
or (<i>b</i>) separated by other sounds. Of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
first kind we have instances in the Anglo-Saxon forms
<i>ascian</i> and <i>axian</i>, both of which occur in extant documents,
and also survive in the verb <i>ask</i> and the
provincial equivalent <i>aks</i>. Cf. also the form <i>brid</i>,
found in Chaucer, for <i>bird</i> (<i>e.g.</i> ‘Ne sey I neuer er
now no <i>brid</i> ne best.’&mdash;Squire’s Tale, 460), and, vice
versâ, <i>birde</i> for <i>bride</i> (<i>e.g.</i> Piers Plowman, 3, 14: ‘ðe
Justices somme Busked hem to ðe boure ðere ðe <i>birde</i>
dwelled’). Again, we may compare the English <i>bourn</i>,
Scotch <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">burn</i>, with Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bron</i>, German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">brunnen</i>; A.S.
<i>irnan</i> and <i>rinnan</i>, both meaning to <i>run</i>, and <i>irn</i>, as
pronounced by a west-countryman, with <i>run</i>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Of the second kind of Metathesis (<i>b</i>) we find traces
in O.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">erila</i>, by the side of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">elira</i> = N.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">erle</i> and
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">eller</i>; A.S. <i>weleras</i>, the lips, as against Gothic <i>wairilos</i>;
O.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ezzih</i>, which must have had the sound of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">etik</i>
before the sound-shifting process began, = Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acetum</i>;
the Italian word, as dialectically pronounced, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grolioso</i> =
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">glorioso</i>; and, again, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">crompare</i> = <i lang="it" xml:lang="uit">comprare</i>; M.H.G.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kokodrille</i> = Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crocodilus</i>. We may also refer to such
cases of mispronunciation as <i>indefakitable</i> for <i>indefatigable</i>.
These are evanescent, because they meet
with speedy correction.</p>

<p>Besides Metathesis, we must class here (2) the
assimilation of two sounds not standing contiguous in
the word (as Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinque</i> from *<i>pinque</i>; original
German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">finfi</i> (five) = *<i>finhwi</i>, etc.), and (3) dissimilations,
as in O.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">turtiltûba</i>, from the Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turtur</i>;
Eng. <i>marble</i>, from Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marbre</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">marmor</i>;
M.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">martel</i> with <i>marter</i>, from <i>martyrium</i>; <i>prîol</i>
with <i>prîor</i>; and conversely, M.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pheller</i> with
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">phellel</i>, from Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palliolum</i>; O.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fluobra</i>, ‘consolation,’
as against O.S. <i>frôfra</i> and A.S. <i>frôfor</i>; M.H.G.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kaladrius</i> with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">karadrius</i>; Middle Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pelegrinus</i>,
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrinus</i>.</p>

<p>We must now conclude this chapter with a few
words on the question, Are the laws of sound-change,
like physical laws, absolute and unchanging? do they
admit of no exceptions? In thus stating the question,
we challenge a comparison between physical laws
and the laws of sound-change, but we must never
forget the essential difference existing between them.
Physical laws lay down what must invariably and
always happen under certain given conditions; the
laws of sound-change state the regularity observed in
any particular group of historic phenomena.</p>

<p>We must, in dealing with this question, further
distinguish between two closely allied but not
identical kinds of phenomena, <i>i.e.</i> between those
which come under the law of sound-change in the
strict sense of the word, and those which are rather
to be considered as instances of sound-correspondence
or sound-interchange. When, for instance, some
sound happened to be, at any particular stage of some
language, identical in the various forms of the same
word; and if this sound, owing to difference in its
position, or of its accent, or from some other cause,
has changed into a different sound in some forms of
the word, while in other forms of the same word it
has remained unchanged; and if many similar cases
are remarked in the same language,&mdash;we summarise
them in our grammars in a form which, though convenient,
is not strictly correct. There are in French,
for instance, many adjectives which form their masculine
termination in <i>f</i> and their feminine in <i>ve</i>. It is
scarcely necessary to point out that in these words
the feminine form, derived as it is from the Latin
feminine, cannot correctly be described as <i>derived</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
from the masculine in its contemporaneous form: nor
yet does the individual speaker, in using the two
genders, derive the one from the other; he reproduces
both from memory, or, possibly by a process to be
discussed in Chapter V., he produces one by analogy
with other similar forms.</p>

<p>We nevertheless lay it down in our grammars, that
adjectives in <i>f</i> form their feminine by ‘changing’ <i>f</i>
into <i>ve</i>. The correspondence of sounds which we
thus register, though it is a consequence of phonetic
development, does not, strictly speaking, express a
law of sound-change; we might call it ‘a law of
sound-correspondence’ or ‘sound-interchange.’ The
‘law of sound-interchange’ states in a convenient form
the aggregate results of events which have occurred in
accordance with some ‘law of sound-change.’ Our
question, then, refers to the ‘laws of sound-change’
proper, and not to those of ‘sound-interchange;’ and
if we say that a law of sound-change admits of no
exceptions, we can only mean that, within the limits
of some definite language or dialect, all cases which
fulfil the same phonetic conditions have had the same
fate: <i>i.e.</i> the same sound must there have changed
into the same other sound throughout the language,
or, where various sounds are seen to replace one and
the same other sound of the older language, the cause
for this difference must be sought in the difference of
phonetic conditions, such as accent, contact with or
proximity to other sounds, etc.</p>

<p>It must be clear, after all that has been said in this
chapter, that laws of sound-change, in the correct
meaning of this term, must be consistent and
absolutely regular. As regards the case of the
individual speaker, we have seen that the utterance
of each sound depends on the memory-picture of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
motion and position, and that these pictures exert their
influence without the speaker being conscious of it.
It will then naturally follow that if these pictures alter
gradually in the case of any one sound in any one
word, they will do so for the same sound in all other
cases where it occurs under like conditions.</p>

<p>It is indeed often stated that the sense of etymological
connection of a particular word with others
which retain a certain sound unaltered may prevent
that sound from taking the same course in that word
as it does in other words not so influenced; but the
existence and efficacy of some counteracting influence
does not disprove the existence of the force against
which it operates, and which it overcomes or
neutralizes. Nor, again, could the inter-communication
between the individual speakers cause occasional
suspension of the law of sound-change.</p>

<p>We have seen that the association which arises
between memory-pictures of the sound, and of the
motion of our vocal organs, etc., for its utterance, is&mdash;though
but external&mdash;nevertheless very close, and that
it soon becomes indissoluble. The slight and gradual
changes in the utterance of the surrounding speakers
alter the memory-pictures of the sound, and the
corresponding memory-picture of motion and position
follows in the same way. It is, then, only in case of
mixture of dialect, <i>i.e.</i> when a considerable group of
speakers of one dialect becomes mixed and scattered
among speakers of another, that the following generation
<i>may</i> adopt one sound from the one dialect and
another from the second; thus apparently exhibiting
the differentiation of the same sound, under the same
phonetic circumstances, into two, of which the one
appears as the rule, the other as the exception. But
then, again, such a case&mdash;though when it has happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
we may not always be aware of it, and consequently
may not always be able to assign the phenomenon to
its true cause&mdash;does not prove that the law of sound-change
admitted of exception. We merely have the
results of two such laws mixed and confused.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="medium">CHANGE IN WORD-SIGNIFICATION.</span></h2>

<p>Sound-change is brought about by the repeated
substitution of a sound or sounds almost imperceptibly
differing from the original. The A.S. <i>hláfmesse</i> is now
represented by the English <i>Lammas</i>: though the <i>mm</i>
sound is clearly easier to pronounce than the combination
represented by <i>fm</i>, generations passed away
before the word as we have it in English became the
recognised form. In the case of sound-change, we
must notice that the rise of the new sound is
simultaneous with the disappearance of the old one.
In the case of change of signification, it is possible for
the old meaning to be maintained by the side of the
new one; as when we speak of ‘the House,’ meaning
the House of Parliament, we do not exclude the
original and proper meaning of the word, but we
merely narrow and define its signification. Indeed,
change in signification consists invariably in a widening
or narrowing of the extent of the signification,
corresponding to which we find an impoverishment or
an enrichment of the contents. As we saw that the
employment of ‘House’ to denote the House of
Parliament implied a narrowing or specialising of the
extent of the signification of the ordinary meaning of
<i>house</i>, so we may take a word like <i>moon</i>, properly and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
originally applied only to the earth’s satellite, and
apply it to a whole class, which we regard in some
way as resembling it, as when we speak of <i>Jupiter’s
moons</i>. In this case we <i>widen</i> the application of the
word by <i>narrowing</i> its contents, but even when thus
<i>widened</i> the meaning still includes its original denotation.
Frequently such a widened application becomes
once more narrowed, by the widening of the contents:
an instance of this double process we have, <i>e.g.</i>, in the
word <i>crane</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Originally only meaning the bird of
that name, it was, by a metaphor, applied to a class of
objects similar in some respects to the bird. A process
of narrowing this application led to the use of the
word as a specific name for a certain machine. The
word, in this sense, no longer includes its original
meaning, and is transferred. It is only by such a
succession of widening and narrowing that a word
can assume a signification absolutely different from
its original meaning. This transference may be more
or less <i>occasional</i>, or become <i>usual</i>. Thus in the case
of <i>green</i> for <i>unripe</i> (<i>cf.</i> blackberries are red when they
are green) the meaning is in a certain sense an
‘occasional’ one, the real and original meaning being
still clearly felt. This original meaning is, however,
quite lost sight of when we use <i>grain</i> in <i>to dye in the
grain</i>, for ‘to dye of a fast colour’ by means of
cochineal, etc., <i>grain</i> here being the name given to
fibre of wood, etc.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Change in signification, however, has this in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
common with sound-change, that it is effected by individual
usage which departs from the common usage;
and that this departure passes only gradually into
common usage. Change in signification is a law of
language; it is a necessity: and change is rendered
possible by the fact that the signification attaching to
a word each time it is employed need not be identical
with that which usage attaches to it. As we shall
have to consider this discrepancy, we shall employ the
expressions ‘usual’ and ‘occasional’ signification: and
by the ‘usual’ we shall understand the ordinary or
general signification; by the ‘occasional’ we shall
understand that which the individual attaches to it at
the particular moment when he uses the word. The
‘usual’ signification means, as we employ it, the entire
contents of any word as it presents itself to a member
of any linguistic community: the ‘occasional’ signification
means the contents of the conception which the
speaker, as he utters the word, connects therewith, and
expects the listener to connect with it likewise. The
word <i>shade</i>, used by itself and without any interpretation
from the context or the situation, would suggest
to a hearer its <small>USUAL</small> signification of ‘interruption of
light;’ but the individual who employs the word may
have in mind, as he may easily disclose, the shade of
a tree or a lamp-shade.</p>

<p>The ‘occasional’ signification is commonly richer
than the ‘usual’ one in content and narrower in extent.
For instance, the word in its occasional sense may
denote something concrete: while, in its usual sense,
it denotes something abstract only; <i>i.e.</i> some general
conception under which different concrete conceptions
may be ranged. By a ‘concrete’ conception is here
meant something presupposed as actually existing,
subject to definite limits of time and space; by an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
‘abstract’ one is here meant a general conception,
the contents of a mere idea and nothing more, freed
from all trammels of time and place. <i>The House of
Commons</i> is concrete: <i>a house</i> is abstract. This
division has nothing to do with the ordinary division
of substantives into abstract and concrete. The substantives
which in ordinary grammar we call ‘concrete’
often denote a conception as general as the
so-called abstract nouns; as in <i>England’s battles</i>: and,
conversely, the latter are occasionally used as what we
here call ‘concretes’ when they are used to express
a single quality or activity defined by limits of space
and time; as, <i>The days of thy youth</i>. In the phrase
‘My horse has run well to-day,’ <i>horse</i> is concrete
in the sense which we attach to the term: but in the
phrase ‘A horse has four legs,’ it is what we call
‘abstract;’ because the statement does not refer to
any one definite concrete horse, but to horses generally,
and the predicate therefore is associated with the
abstract idea of <i>horse</i>.</p>

<p>The greater number of words can be employed in
occasional use in either abstract or concrete significations.
There are some words, indeed, essentially concrete,
such as <i>thou</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>to-day</i>, <i>yesterday</i>;&mdash;which,
however, need individual application to render
them immediately and definitely concrete. Words
like <i>I</i>, <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, serve to define some one’s position
in the concrete world; but it requires the aid of other
words, or of the circumstances in which they are
uttered, to render them thus definite. Even our
demonstrative pronouns, and the word <i>the</i>, may be
employed to denote abstract conceptions; as, <i>The
whale is a mammal; it has warm blood</i>. <i>Pity the
widow and the orphan.</i> Even proper names, which
we might be inclined at first to take as the type of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
concrete words, as denoting a single object or person,
may be used either ‘usually’ as concrete, or ‘occasionally’
as abstract, since the same name may be borne
by various people and various localities, as <i>Newton</i>,
<i>Brighton</i>: and, indeed, may be applied to objects
named after localities; as <i>Stilton</i>, <i>Champagne</i>, etc.
Then there is a small class of words which express
an object conceived of as existing once and once only,
such as <i>God</i>, <i>devil</i>, <i>world</i>, <i>universe</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>sun</i>. These
nouns are concrete both in their ‘usual’ and in almost
all their ‘occasional’ meanings; but even they may be
regarded as abstract if regarded from a definite point
of view. Indeed, a proper name is essentially concrete;
if it becomes abstract, this can only be because
it has become a generic name, <i>i.e.</i> because it has
become a common noun, a common noun being such
in virtue of its standing as the name of each individual
of a class or group of things. On the other hand,
there are some words which from their very nature
are abstract; such are the pronouns <i>ever</i>, <i>any</i>; the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quisquam</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ullus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unquam</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uspiam</i>; but the
abstract character even of words like these suffers
certain limitations in occasional usage; cf. <i>Did he
ever</i> (<i>i.e.</i> on any particular occasion) <i>act so</i>, and <i>Should
he ever really do it</i>. In these cases <i>ever</i> is in the first
instance limited to the past, and in the second to the
future.</p>

<p>A more important and deeper-lying distinction
between ‘usual’ and ‘occasional’ signification is that
a word may have various ‘usual’ significations, but
can only bear a single ‘occasional’ one; <i>i.e.</i> in each
case of ‘occasional’ use the meaning is one and definite:<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
except, indeed, when the word is of set purpose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
used ambiguously, either to deceive, or to point a
witticism; as in ‘If you get the best of port, port will
get the best of you.’ It happens in all languages that
there occur words identically pronounced which may be
understood in different significations: and, for practical
purposes, we must regard these as the same word,
since whoever hears the sounds of which the word is
composed spoken cannot, without the aid of the connection,
possibly tell which of the senses is intended
by the speaker to be attached to the word. Under this
head must be ranged, in the first place, words which
accidentally happen to correspond in sound, though
they differ in meaning. The English language is
particularly full of such words, owing, in some degree,
to the coincidence of many words coming from Norman
French with words coming from a Teutonic source.
Such are <i>mean</i>, intend; <i>mean</i>, common; <i>mean</i>,
moyen: <i>match</i>, a contest; <i>match</i>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mèche</span>: <i>sound</i>, son
and ge-sund. We have, in these and similar cases,
instances of words which usually receive several significations.
But besides these we have numerous words
in English, as in other languages, which are etymologically
identical and which yet have several significations.
Such is the word <i>box</i> in English: it means in
the first and most common case, ‘a chest to put things
in;’ then, ‘a tree,’ ‘a small seated compartment in
the auditorium of a theatre,’ ‘the driver’s seat on a
carriage,’ ‘a present given at Christmas’ in the combination
‘a Christmas box;’ besides the meaning of a
‘box on the ear,’ which comes from a different source.
Such, too, are: <i>post</i> = (1) ‘A stake in the ground,’ (2)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
‘a professional situation,’ (3) ‘the system of delivering
the mails;’ <i>broom</i>, the shrub, and <i>broom</i>, ‘a besom;’
<i>bull</i>, ‘a papal edict’ and ‘a blunder in language;’
<i>canon</i>, ‘a rule’ and ‘a church dignitary;’ to <i>bait a
horse</i> and to <i>bait a hook</i>; a <i>coach</i> in the sense of ‘a
teacher’ and of ‘a carriage;’ <i>board</i>, ‘a plank’ or
‘food supplied at lodging-houses:’ so in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
radical</i>, ‘a root in language,’ ‘a root in algebra,’ ‘a
radical in chemistry,’ or ‘a radical politician;’ <i>plume</i>,
‘a feather,’ and <i>plume</i>, ‘a pen;’ Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">examen</i>, ‘swarm,’
‘tongue of a balance,’ and ‘examination.’ It is true
that the derived meanings in these words spring from
a primary one, but it is equally true that it is impossible,
without some knowledge of the history of the
word, to recognise the original connection between the
various significations; and these bear the same relations
to each other as if the identity in sound were
purely accidental. This is especially true in cases
where the primary meaning has entirely disappeared,
as in the case of <i>villain</i>, used now only in the uncomplimentary
sense which circumstances have affixed to
the word, save, indeed, in historical treatises; though
even in its early sense it is no longer ‘the man who
lives and works on the <i>villa</i>.’ It is the same with <i>pagan</i>,
and <i>recreant</i>. Another good illustration is afforded by
the word <i>impertinent</i>, which signifies (1) not pertinent
(obsolete); (2) having no special pertinency, trifling;
(3) rude. Etymology, working by comparison, often
serves to detect such disappearances: thus N.H.G.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">klein</i>, small, has lost its original meaning, that still
appears in Eng. <i>clean</i>.</p>

<p>But in many cases, too, where we can still recognise
the relationship of the derived to the primary
signification, we must nevertheless acknowledge the
independence of the derived meaning; especially where,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
as in the case of ‘post,’ it has become the usual one.
The test, in these cases, of the independence of the
word is whether a word ‘occasionally’ used in the derivative
sense can be understood without any necessity
arising for the primary meaning to force itself on the
consciousness of the speaker or hearer. There are,
further, two negative tests whereby we may judge that
a word has not a simple, but a complex signification.
The first of these is if no simple definition can be
framed, including the whole of its meaning, and neither
more nor less; and the second, if the word cannot, if
employed ‘occasionally,’ be used in the whole extent
of its signification. It is easy to apply these tests to
the examples cited above. No simple definition of
the word <i>post</i> would be possible; a whole series
would be necessary to explain the meaning of the
word to a foreigner. Again, any definition of the
word <i>post</i> used in the ‘occasional’ sense of ‘a situation’
would leave the other meanings quite unexplained.</p>

<p>Even in cases where the ‘usual’ signification may
be regarded as simple, the individual meaning may
vary from this and yet may not become concrete, as it
may develop on the lines of one of the special meanings
included in the general conception. Thus the
simple word <i>pin</i> may, in single cases, be understood as
<i>lynch-pin</i>, <i>hair-pin</i>, etc.; so <i>bye-law</i> is now always used
as if it were a secondary law.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>All understanding between individuals depends
upon the correspondence in their psychical attitude.
In order that a word may be understood in its ‘usual’
meaning, no more perfect mental correspondence is
imperative than such as naturally exists between the
members of a single linguistic community who have
mastered their own language; should, however, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
signification of a word be specialised in ‘occasional’
use, as when we speak of ‘the House,’ and understand
thereby ‘the House of Parliament,’ a closer understanding
must be supposed to exist among the speakers.
The same words may be intelligible or otherwise, or,
again, may be misunderstood, according to the state
of mind of the person who is addressed; or, again,
according to the chance surroundings, whose presence
or absence may act as an aid or a drawback to the
enforcement of the signification. And it seems well
in this place to emphasise the fact that the body of
ideas which may at any time be called up by a word is
<i>never the same</i> in the case of any two speakers. The
ideas will resemble each other less as the speakers are
members of social communities more widely separated
from each other, or more in proportion as the persons
using the words possess similar degrees of cultivation or
life-experience. For instance, we may understand all
the words of a philosophic discussion, and still it may
remain a mere jargon to us. This truth holds good
even for the simplest language in its simplest stage.
Hence it is that no perfect translation of a literary
masterpiece is possible; especially if such be written in
the idiom of a civilisation far removed from that of
the translator, alike in the circuit of ideas, and in the
way in which these ideas present themselves. Every
expression is in fact accompanied by a store of associative
suggestion, which <i>must</i> suffer loss to a greater
or less extent in the attempt to insert an equivalent
expression from a stranger tongue. It thus results that
the interpreter of the language of a past civilisation
must undertake by laborious study to reconstruct and
attach to each expression the body of associations
which should be its native environment. The aids
necessary for understanding words in their ‘occasional’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
meaning do not require to be of a linguistic nature at
all; although they may, on the other hand, be so.
We have seen before that abstract words may be
rendered concrete by connecting them with such words
as essentially express the concrete, and that the article
is one of the chief of these words. <i>Horse</i> is abstract,
but <i>the horse</i> is generally, as we have seen, concrete.
But even this rule is not absolute, and consequently
this aid is not absolutely sufficient; for we have seen
that in expressions like <i>The horse is a quadruped</i>, the
article has come to express the general conception.
Again, there are languages, like Latin and Russian,
which have developed no article; and these employ
abstract words, with no special mark of denotation, for
the concrete.</p>

<p>In any case, whether the reference to the ‘concrete’
is expressly denoted or not, other methods may be
adopted to define it more closely. The first of these
depends upon the common environment of the speaker
and hearer, and upon the perception common to both.
The hearer cannot fail to understand the speaker if,
in referring to a tree or tower, he means the definite
single tree or tower which they both have before their
eyes. The speaker may point to the object in question,
or may indicate its position by his gaze. Nay, such
signs may serve to indicate objects not directly cognisable
by the senses, provided that the direction in
which these objects lie is known.</p>

<p>Another method whereby the word is made to
refer to something definite and concrete is found in the
recalling by the hearer of the past utterances of the
speaker, or, it may be, in a special explanation which
the speaker has given. If the hearer understands that
a word is once intended to bear a concrete sense, then
this same sense may continue to attach to the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
throughout the rest of the conversation. If ‘the
Church’ have once been spoken of in the sense of ‘the
body of adherents to the Church of England,’ it will
be understood that this is the sense in which the word
‘Church’ is to be apprehended for the rest of the
conversation. The recollection of the previous utterance
will take the place of immediate perception.
Again, this reference to the past can be emphasised by
words like demonstrative pronouns and adverbs. If,
after using ‘the Church’ in a definite sense, I employ
a phrase like ‘that Church’ or ‘that Church of which
I spoke,’ it is clear that this word ‘that,’ whose function
was originally merely to express a perception, serves
in its new function to call attention to the individualisation
of the signification and to render it intelligible
to the hearer.</p>

<p>In the third place, anything is capable of being
represented and understood as concrete, when the
speaker and the hearer are so similarly circumstanced
that the same thoughts naturally rise into the consciousness
of both at once. Such agreement or correspondence
depends upon such circumstances as common
residence, common age, common tastes, business, or
surroundings of the speakers. An instance of this
is seen in the rhetorical usage commonly known as
κατ’ ἐξοχην. If two people live near together in the
country in the neighbourhood of a large town, they
would both certainly understand by ‘going <i>to town</i>’
the town nearest to where they happen to live. If, on
the other hand, they both had their business in London,
they would certainly both understand ‘London’ by
‘town.’ Again, words like the <i>town-hall</i>, <i>the square</i>,
<i>the market</i> are understood by the inhabitants of a
particular town to refer to the town-hall or market of
that particular town. Again, such words as <i>the kitchen</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
<i>the larder</i>, when spoken of by members of a family,
refer to the rooms in their particular house, which
they know by these names. Thus, again, in speaking
of <i>Sunday</i>, we mean the nearest Sunday to the
day on which we are speaking; and, in fact, the Sunday
can be fixed with <i>perfect</i> precision by merely affixing
to the word <i>Sunday</i> a word expressing past or
future; as, <i>next Sunday</i>, <i>last Sunday</i>. Words expressing
relationship between persons are naturally and
without effort transferred to persons who bear such
relationship to hearer and speaker alike: and what is
more, no doubt can arise from the use of the singular,
as long as there is only one person who could naturally
bear the description. Thus, if the children of a
family speak to each other of ‘father’ or ‘mother,’
this concrete reference is just as intelligible to them as
that of ‘the Queen’ or ‘the President’ to the British
or the Americans respectively. Nay, even though the
relationship exists only upon one side, whether of the
speaker or the hearer, the reference may still be equally
unmistakable, assuming that circumstances aid in
pointing to the person named. If one man says to
another ‘The wife is better,’ the hearer would at once
understand that the speaker’s <i>own wife</i> was referred to,
assuming that her illness had been previously discussed
between the two.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, a speaker may employ some
more closely defining word, as an epithet, in order to
render his meaning more definite and concrete. Thus
he might say, <i>That is the old king’s palace</i>, <i>That is the
royal castle</i>. But even such defining epithets as these
fail to give a perfect definition unless some other aid,
like the memory aid of which we have spoken, or the
aid of the situation, supports the definition. If the
speakers have been conversing about ‘the old king,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
both <i>palace</i> and <i>castle</i> would receive a concrete significance
from what had been said before. Thus, the
phrase ‘the king’s castle’ comes to mean a single
object only, when it is known that the king has only
one castle, or if the hearer be referred to a single place,
where he must know the castle to lie.</p>

<p>Finally, a concrete word may affect other words
connected with it, and may give them a concrete sense
as well. In sentences like <i>John never moved a finger</i>;
<i>I never laid hand upon him</i>; <i>I took him by the arm</i>; <i>You
hit me on the shoulder</i>, the words <i>finger</i> and <i>hand</i> get
their concrete meaning from the subject, and <i>arm</i> and
<i>shoulder</i> from the object.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> In French, in the sentence,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il sauta dans l’eau, la tête la première</i>, ‘<span  lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la tête</span>’ acquires
its concrete sense from the subject.</p>

<p>Just as general names receive a definite concrete
reference, so proper names applicable to different
persons come to denote but a single one. It may be
sufficient merely to speak of a man as ‘Charles’ in
order to sufficiently identify him; and indeed such
reference would suffice if he were before us, or had
recently been mentioned. Again, even without this,
the name ‘Charles’ would sufficiently identify any
person within his own family, or within any other
circle where no other ‘Charles’ was known. Under
other circumstances, we must naturally define him
more closely; as, ‘Charles the Sixth of France,’
‘Charles the First of England.’ Just so, there are
many places bearing the same name; but a single
name is sufficient to define the place for the neighbourhood,
and even for the world at large when the place
happens to be the most important of the places called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
by the name: cf. <i>Melbourne</i>, <i>Brisbane</i>, <i>London</i>, <i>Strassburg</i>:
otherwise a nearer definition has to be employed,
as <i>Stony Stratford</i>, <i>Newton-le-Willows</i>.</p>

<p>Words are <i>specialised</i> in meaning in the same way
as they are defined and rendered concrete, and by the
same factors. When we hear a word, we naturally think
of the most obvious and common of its various meanings,
or else of its primary meaning. In the case of ‘train,’
we think of the means of locomotion: in the case
of ‘crane’ we probably think of the bird. Sometimes
the two tendencies work together. Should several
meanings tolerably common stand side by side, the
primary meaning will commonly present itself to the
mind of the hearer before the others; as in the case
of the word <i>head</i> used in so many metaphorical senses.
But this general rule is liable again to be altered by
the surroundings amid which the word is uttered.
The situation awakens certain groups of ideas in the
mind of the hearer before the word is uttered, and
itself aids powerfully in fixing the meaning. We
affix a different meaning to the word <i>sheet</i> according
as we hear it in a haberdasher’s shop, or on a yacht, or
at a book-binder’s: as we do to the words ‘to bind,’
according as we hear them in a book-binder’s or in a
harvest field. Different trades and professions use the
same word and affix their own meaning to it, and no
ambiguity arises in their own circle: take such words
as ‘a goose’ in the mouth of a tailor; ‘a form’ among
hatters. Then, again, the connection in which a word
occurs does much to fix its meaning. Observe how the
meaning is affected by the connection in such utterances
as <i>a good point</i>, <i>a point of view</i>, <i>a point of honour</i>; <i>the
bar of a river</i>, <i>the bar of a hotel</i>, <i>the bar of justice</i>;
<i>the foot of a mountain</i>, <i>the foot of a table</i>; <i>the tongue
of a woman</i>, <i>a tongue of land</i>, <i>the tongue of a balance</i>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
<i>a crowded ball</i>, <i>a round ball</i>; <i>a gulf or bay</i>, <i>a bay and a roan</i>; <i>the
cock crows</i>, <i>the cock is turned on</i>; <i>ere the king’s crown go
down there are crowns to be broke</i>; <i>the train is starting</i>,
<i>a train of thought</i>; <i>a bitter draught</i>, <i>a bitter reputation</i>;
<i>clean linen</i>, <i>a clean heart</i>; <i>a donkey-engine</i>, <i>John is a
donkey</i>; <i>the money goes</i>, <i>the mill goes</i>; <i>to stand still</i>, <i>to
stand upon ceremony</i>, <i>to stand at ease</i>.</p>

<p>Cases may, however, occur in which the ‘<i>occasional</i>’
meaning may not include all the elements of the ‘<i>usual</i>’
meaning, while it may contain something beyond and
above this. Take, for instance, the words expressive of
colour, such as <i>blue</i>, <i>red</i>, <i>yellow</i>, <i>white</i>, <i>black</i>. These
words may be used to denote colours which, according to
their simple meaning, they are inadequate to denote.
Each colour may be mixed with another colour, and
there must arise a succession of transition stages for
which language has no name. For instance, the
northern word <i>blae</i> varies in meaning from the purple
colour of the blaeberry to the dull grey of unbleached
cottons;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> while the same word in old Spanish takes
the form <i lang="sp" xml:lang="sp">blavo</i>, and is found to mean <i>yellowish grey</i>.
Three centuries ago, <i>auburn</i> meant ‘whitish,’ and
<i>drab</i> meant ‘no colour at all’ (= Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drap</i>, ‘undyed
cloth’).</p>

<p>But the widest field for such inadequate application
as that which we have been instancing is given by
words whose signification consists of a complex
assembly of ideas, as is the case, for instance, in
metaphorical expressions. Metaphorical expressions
are nothing else than comparisons instituted between
groups of ideas <i>with respect to what they possess in
common</i>. We compare in these only certain characteristics,
and we leave the rest out of account. If we say
of a man <i>He is a fox</i>, we mean merely that some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the qualities which go to make up the conception of a
fox are found in the man as well. We may, indeed,
express the point of comparison between the two, as
by saying <i>He is as crafty as a fox</i>. On the other hand,
we might say more simply <i>He is foxy</i>, in which case
the adjective merely denotes such a selection of the
qualities of a fox as may be necessary to characterise
the man sufficiently: and, finally, we may say <i>He is a
fox</i>, whereby we merely mean that he is in several
respects like a fox. In this case, then, the words <i>foxy</i>
and <i>fox</i> have passed beyond the limits of their proper
signification. They have come to denote a single
quality only, instead of a group of qualities, and this
signification has come to be usual.</p>

<p>A word may, again, pass beyond the limits of its
strict signification by the operation of what rhetoricians
call <i>synecdoche</i>, or naming a thing by some prominent
or characteristic part of it; as, ‘A fleet of twenty
<i>sail</i>;’ ‘All <i>hands</i> to the pumps;’ ‘They sought his
<i>blood</i>.’ In this case, something connected spatially,
or temporally, or causally with the usual meaning is
understood with the word when it is spoken.</p>

<p>When a word passes beyond the limits of its usual
signification, it is liable to be misunderstood, unless,
indeed, some impulse be present to serve as a sign-post
to the sense in which it is intended to be used.
We are naturally inclined to use a word in its ordinary
meaning and in no other, unless, indeed, we are
reminded by something that its ordinary sense is
impossible. In simple cases, such as the proverb,
<i>Speech is silvern, but silence is golden</i>, we think of the
predicates as used metaphorically, simply because it is
impossible to think of them as used in any other sense.
But when Shakespeare talks about <i>the majesty of
buried Denmark</i>, each principal word in the combination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
serves as a sign-post to the sense in which each
other word is to be used, and we are enabled to guess
the sense which we are to attach to each word.</p>

<p>Repeated departures from the usual meaning&mdash;in
other words, the repeated employment of the occasional
meanings of words&mdash;end in a true change of
signification. The more regularly these departures
occur, the more, of course, do individual peculiarities
approximate to common use. The test of the transition
from an ‘occasional’ to a ‘usual’ meaning is whether
the employment of the ‘occasional’ meaning brings
into the mind of the speaker or hearer a previous
usage with which he was familiar, and in which he will
naturally understand the word. When such recollection
naturally presents itself to the mind, and when
the word is employed, as well as understood, with no
reference to the original signification of the word, then
the word may fairly be deemed to have accomplished
its transition of meaning. But it is clear that there
may be many gradations between the two usages. If
I speak of <i>sweet</i> memories or of a <i>bright</i> future, there
may or may not be any recollection on the part of the
speaker or hearer that these expressions are metaphors
from the use of the word <i>sweet</i> and <i>bright</i> in a physical
sense.</p>

<p>It must further be remarked that it is difficult for
the <i>occasional</i> meaning of a word to pass into the
<i>usual</i> by the aid of an individual, unless those to
whom he speaks reciprocate the influence which he
has exerted upon them. Milton, for instance, uses
such words as <i>expatiate</i> and <i>extravagant</i> in their Latin
sense, and <i>hear</i> in the sense of ‘to be called;’ thus,
again, Chaucer and others use <i>copy</i> (copia) in the
sense of <i>plenty</i>: but these words were not taken up by
a sufficiently large number of persons to enable their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
‘occasional’ use to become ‘usual,’ even though introduced
by such authorities as these.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Words have a strong tendency to change their
meaning when they pass into the mouth of a new
generation. A child fixes the meaning of a word by
hasty and imperfect generalisations; and not by means
of descriptive or exhaustive definitions. The simple
and unreflecting mind of childhood identifies objects
on very imperfect grounds, and stays not to consider
whether there be any basis for such identification or
not.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> And thus it is that, from the very first steps in
the process of acquiring language, the child employs
the same word to define several objects, and these
not objects which <i>really resemble each other, but which
have the appearance in any degree of doing so</i>. Of
course this whole proceeding implies that no clear conception
can exist of the contents and extent of the usual
meaning. A child conceives of a word as covering
an extent sometimes too narrow, sometimes too wide;
more commonly, however, too wide than too narrow,
and the more so as the extent of his words is the more
limited. He will include <i>a sofa</i> under the name of <i>a
chair</i>; <i>an umbrella</i> under that of <i>a stick</i>; <i>a cap</i> under
that of <i>a hat</i>; and this repeatedly. Another cause of
inexact appreciation of meaning is the fact that the
speaker, when indicating to a child certain objects,
connects them in his own mind with certain other
objects; the child may fail to understand the limitations
of meaning to be placed upon the word when it is
parted from the idea as a whole. Take, for instance,
such a word as <i>congregation</i>. In the mouth of a
clergyman, this word might be used as an inseparable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
adjunct of a church, but he will still speak of the <i>congregation</i>
as distinguished from the church, and as
forming a distinct though necessary connection with
the idea of ‘Church.’ The child, generalising faultily,
may apply the word <i>congregation</i> to a collection of
politicians, or of traders, or of animals; and it may be
long before he is in a position to correct his wrong
conception. The adult, again, constantly has to encounter
the same difficulties as the child, when he meets
with words of rare occurrence or denoting technical
or complex ideas; and, supposing that he learns such
words by their occasional application only, he is exposed
to the same errors as the child. Thus the word
<i>insect</i> has come to be so commonly used to mark the
distinction between insects and other animals, that we
read on labels, <i>This powder is harmless to animal
life, but kills all insects</i>.</p>

<p>These inaccuracies in the case of the apprehension
of the usual meaning are, taken singly, of little account,
and are commonly corrected by the standard or ordinary
usage which the speaker will naturally hear from
the mouths of the greater part of the community. At
the same time, in cases where a large number of individuals
unite in a partial misapprehension or in
investing simultaneously a word with an ‘occasional’
meaning, it will happen that this, though only partially
corresponding with the meaning which was usual
amongst an older generation, will be substituted.</p>

<p>Such, among others, are the significations attaching
to certain terms, expressive of qualities ennobled by
Christianity, such as <i>humility</i>, <i>faith</i>, <i>spiritual</i>, <i>ghostly</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>Commonly speaking, the older generation gives the
main impulse to change of meaning, controlling, as it
does, the whole usage of language. But the younger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
generation has great power in aiding the process of
change, from the fact that the very first time that a word
has presented itself to one of its members, the word may
have been used in an ‘occasional’ sense, which would
by him have been taken to be its regular use. Thus, a
child might often hear a horse spoken of as <i>a bay</i>, or a
dolt as <i>an ass</i>. In such cases he understands the
secondary meaning only; nor does he even mentally
connect this meaning with any other.</p>

<p>The change in ‘usual’ signification, then, takes its
rise from modification in the ‘occasional’ application
of the word. The most common case of change in
signification owing to such modification, is where the
meaning of the word is specialised by the narrowing
of its comprehension and the enrichment of its contents.
In the English word <i>stamp</i> we have a good
instance of the difference between ‘occasional’ and
‘usual’ specialisation. The word may be employed of
any object used as a particular mark. It may be used
for a <i>receipt stamp</i> or for a <i>bill stamp</i>, or, again,
metaphorically, as the <i>stamp of nobility</i>. These are
instances of ‘occasional’ specialisation. But, while it
requires some definite situation to make us think of
<i>stamp</i> in its other significations, it immediately occurs
to us to think of it as a <i>postage stamp</i>, and we then
think little, if at all, of the general idea of stamping,
but rather of an object of definite shape and construction
and used for the definite purpose of franking
letters. We must thus admit that this meaning has
parted from the more general meanings, and stands
independently as a special meaning; in fact, that it is
specialised and ‘usual.’ Other examples are the use of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frumentum</i> for ‘corn’ in Latin; <i>fruit</i> for the produce
of certain trees as distinguished from ‘the fruits of the
earth;’ <i>pig</i>, originally the young of animals;&mdash;in Danish,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
<i lang="da" xml:lang="da">pige</i>, a young girl. <i>Corn</i>, in English, is restricted to
‘wheat,’ and, in America, to <i>maize</i>, or Indian corn;
while, in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">korn</i> denotes any species of grain:
<i>fowl</i>, in English, means specially ‘a barn-door fowl;’ <i>a
bird</i> means, in the language of sportsmen, ‘a partridge;’
<i>a fish</i>, ‘a salmon:’ ὄρνις, in the conventional language of
Athens, as disclosed by the Comic poets, means ‘a
barn-door fowl:’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and a special usage of this kind is
seen in the names of materials themselves employed
to denote the products of materials; as, <i>glass</i>, <i>horn</i>,
<i>gold</i>, <i>silver</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>copper</i>,&mdash;as when we talk of paper
in the sense of <i>paper money</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Proper names owe their origin to the change of the
‘occasional’ concrete meanings of certain words into
‘usual’ meanings. All names of persons and places
took their origin from names of species; and the usage
κατ’ ἐξοχήν was the starting-point for this process. We
are able to observe it distinctly in numerous instances
of names both of persons and of places. Such ordinary
names as the following are very instructive for our
purpose: <i>Field</i>, <i>Hill</i>, <i>Bridges</i>, <i>Townsend</i>, <i>Hedges</i>,
<i>Church</i>, <i>Stone</i>, <i>Meadows</i>, <i>Newton</i>, <i>Villeneuve</i>, <i>Newcastle</i>,
<i>Neuchâtel</i>, <i>Neuburg</i>, <i>Milltown</i>, etc. Such names
as these served in the first instance merely to indicate
to neighbours a certain person or town: and they were
sufficient to distinguish such person or town from
others in the neighbourhood. They passed into
regular proper names as soon as they were apprehended
in this concrete sense by neighbours too far
removed to judge of the reasons why they received
their special name: cf. names like <i>Pont newydd</i>: and
names like <i>Bevan</i>, <i>Pritchard</i>, from <i>ab (son) Evan</i> and
<i>ap Richard</i>. There are, no doubt, beside these, many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
place-names which began by resembling real proper
names, in so far as they are derived from names of
persons: such are <i>Kingston</i>, <i>St. Helens</i>.</p>

<p>There is also one kind of specialising process which
begins to operate as soon as ever a word comes into
use. Instances of this may be seen in the case of
words which may be derived at will, according to the
ordinary laws of any language, from other words in
common use, but which are not employed till a special
need calls them into play. Such words as these are
sometimes found, in the first stage of their descent from
the root-word, to bear a more special meaning than the
derivative, as such, would naturally bear. Thus the
substantive formations in <i>-er</i> (A.S. <i>-er</i>, <i>-e</i>)<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> denote
properly a person who stands in some relation to the
idea of the root-word&mdash;commonly speaking, expressing
the agent: but in the case of single words thus
terminated the most varied instances of specialisation
are found.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> <i>The ‘pauser’ reason</i> (Macbeth, II. iii. 117)
would naturally mean reason that pauses or halts; but
Shakespeare uses it as the ‘reason that makes us
pause;’&mdash;similarly, there is no reason why the word
<i>scholar</i> (M.E. <i>scolere</i>), an imitation of Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scholaris</i>,
should not signify ‘he who schools or teaches;’ but,
as a matter of fact, it always seems to have borne its
present sense. In English, indeed, it bears the special
sense of ‘a student enjoying the benefit of a foundation.’
A <i>poulterer</i> is one who vends poultry: a <i>fisher</i>
is one who tries to catch fish; a <i>burgher</i>, one who
dwells in a burgh; a <i>falconer</i>, one who trains falcons,
or one who hawks for sport: while a <i>pensioner</i> is one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
who receives a pension. Take, again, the case of verbs
derived from substantives, like <i>to butter</i>, <i>to head</i>, <i>to top</i>,
<i>to badger</i>, <i>to earwig</i>, <i>to dust</i>, <i>to water</i>, <i>to pickle</i>, <i>to bone</i>
(<i>a fowl</i>,) <i>to skin</i>, <i>to clothe</i>, <i>to book</i> (<i>a debt</i>). In many of
these cases, the meaning of the verb is derived from a
metaphorical sense of the substantive. In this case,
too, the usage can only be formed gradually, and
according to the general fundamental conditions of
language.</p>

<p>When language demands the expression of a
conception hitherto undenoted, one of the most
obvious expedients is to choose a word expressive of
the most prominent characteristics of the conception,
as to name the horse ‘the swift animal’ (Sans.
<i>açvas</i>), or the wolf the ‘grey animal’ or ‘the
tearer.’ Many substantives have arisen in this way
(cf. the old terms ‘a grey’ and ‘a brock’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> for a
badger), but we must not therefore conclude that
there was any general rule for such formation; such
as, for instance, that all substantives proceeded from
verbs.</p>

<p>The second principal kind of change in signification
is the converse of the kind already spoken of. It is
where the application of the term is limited to one
part only of its original content, though such reduction
on one side is commonly accompanied by amplification
on another.</p>

<p>The great number of phenomena occurring under
this head renders it hard to classify them: but certain
ones of marked peculiarity may be mentioned. In
some cases we name the object from its appearance to
our sight: as in the case of the <i>eye</i> of a potato, the
<i>head</i> or <i>heart</i> of a cabbage, the <i>arm</i> of a river, the <i>cup</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of a flower, the <i>bed</i> of a river. A statue or a picture
is named after what it represents; as, <i>an Apollo</i>, <i>a
Laocoon</i>, <i>the Adoration of the Magi</i>: or, again, a work
of art is named after its executor; as, <i>a Phidias</i>, <i>a
Praxiteles</i>. In all such cases the original signification
has been limited in one direction and amplified in
another. For instance, in the case of ‘the <i>bed</i> of a
river,’ we exclude from consideration other beds, such
as beds for sleeping on; but, on the other hand, the
word may be applied in its novel sense to as many
rivers as flow and have <i>beds</i>. We call a part of one
object after the part of another object which corresponds
to it in position; we talk of the <i>neck</i> or <i>belly</i>
of a bottle, of the <i>shoulder</i> of a mountain, the <i>foot</i> of a
ladder, the <i>tail</i> of a kite. The different uses of <i>caput</i>
are mostly reproduced in our own use of <i>head</i>; as, <i>caput
urbis</i>; <i>capitolium</i>; <i>caput fontis</i>, fountain head; <i>caput
montis</i>, κορυφή; <i>caput conspirationis</i>; Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">capo</i>; <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">caput
arboris</i>; <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">caput libri</i>, chapter, κεφάλαιον; <i>caput pecuniæ</i>,
capital; cape. We call a measure by the name of some
object which in some way resembles it in dimensions;
as, <i>a cubit</i>, <i>an ell</i>, <i>a foot</i>, <i>a barley-corn</i>. A <i>pen</i> or <i>feather</i>
writes: and so ‘a pen’ and ‘une plume’ may mean
<i>a steel pen</i>. We transfer words expressive of conceptions
of time to conceptions of place, and <i>vice versâ</i>, as
in <i>long</i> and <i>short</i>; <i>before</i>, <i>after</i>; <i>behind</i>, <i>before</i>: and
thus in the case of many other adverbs and prepositions.
We transfer the impressions made on one
sense to those made on another, as in the cases of
<i>sweet</i>; <i>beautiful</i>; <i>loud</i> (originally applicable to hearing
alone), in the phrase ‘loud colours;’ and the
Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyant</i>, in such a phrase as <i>une couleur voyante</i>,
originally applicable to the sense of sight alone.
Words which in their proper sense denote sensual and
corporeal ideas only, are transferred to the denotation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
of ideas spiritual and intellectual: as in the cases of
<i>apprehension</i>, <i>comprehension</i>, <i>reflection</i>, <i>spirit</i>, <i>inclination</i>,
<i>penchant</i>, <i>appetite</i>, <i>penser</i> (lit. <i>peser</i> = to weigh,
etc.). Consider, again, the various applications of such
words as <i>to feel</i>, <i>to see</i>; <i>bitter</i>, <i>lovely</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>mean</i>, <i>dirty</i>,
<i>great</i>, <i>small</i>, <i>lofty</i>, <i>low</i>, <i>warm</i>; <i>taste</i>, <i>fire</i>, <i>passion</i>; <i>to
sting</i>, <i>to thrill</i>, etc. Words which properly denote one
species only are given a wider extension; as, <i>cat</i>, <i>crab</i>,
<i>apple</i>, <i>rose</i>, <i>moon</i> (as in Jupiter’s moons), <i>fishery</i> (as in
whale-fishery, lobster-fishery, after the analogy of the
herring-fishery, etc.), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sanglier</i> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’animal solitaire</span>, <i>singularis</i>),
<i>le fromage</i> (lac formaticum, <i>milk made into
shape</i>), <i>le baudet</i> (O.Fr. bald, baud, <i>the spirited
animal</i>,&mdash;originally <i>the male ass</i>). We make proper
names pass into class names, as when we speak of <i>a
Cicero</i>, <i>a Nelson</i>, <i>a Cato</i>; <i>an Academy</i>, from Plato’s
gymnasium near Athens, called Ἀκαδημία; <i>Palace</i>, from
Palatium, the seat of Augustus’ Palace. Thus, again,
we actually talk of a wooden house as being dilapidated.
And we have such further development as <i>a martinet</i>;
<i>a cannibal</i>; <i>a vandal</i>; <i>Tom</i>, <i>Dick</i>, and <i>Harry</i>; <i>John
Doe</i> and <i>Richard Roe</i>. Such adjectives as <i>romantic</i>,
<i>Gothic</i>, <i>pre-adamite</i>, may also serve as illustrations of
the development, which is also manifest in the case of
<i>sehr</i>, ‘very,’ formerly meaning ‘painful,’ of Eng. <i>sore</i>,
with the like use in ‘<i>sore</i> afraid.’ So compare <i>schlecht</i>
(schlechterdings, schlichten) with <i>slight</i>, primitive
signification ‘plain;’ <i>silly</i> with <i>selig</i>, etc. The transference
in the case of verbs is seen in such cases as ‘I
was sorry to <i>find</i> you out when I called;’ ‘He <i>enjoys</i>
poor health,’ etc. This development is similar to that
illustrated above by <i>apprehension</i>, <i>reflection</i>, etc., to
which we may add <i>understand</i>, <i>verstehen</i>, ἐπίστασθαι,
<i>transpire</i>.</p>

<p>The third principal division of change in meaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
is the transference of the idea to what is connected
with the fundamental conception of the word by some
relation of place, or time, or cause.</p>

<p>The simplest sub-division of this is when a part
is substituted for the whole&mdash;the figure called by
rhetoricians <i>synecdoche</i>, and referred to before on p. 58.
The part is, in such cases, always a prominent
characteristic; it suggests, as a rule, that aspect of the
whole which it is desired to bring into prominence for
rhetorical effect. Thus, ‘all <i>hands</i> to the pumps;’
‘they sought his <i>blood</i>;’ ‘the <i>blade</i>,’ for ‘the <i>sword</i>;’ ‘a
maid of twelve <i>summers</i>.’ The German word <i>Bein</i>
(leg) = Eng. <i>bone</i>, has been thus used by synecdoche:
it retains its older value in <i>Gebeine</i>, <i>Elfenbein</i>.
Persons and animals are named after characteristic
features in the body or the mind; as, <i>grey-beard</i>, <i>curly-head</i>,
<i>thick-head</i>, <i>red-breast</i>, <i>fire-tail</i>; <i>a good soul</i>, <i>a
bright spirit</i>: in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanc-bec</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grosse-tête</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge-gorge</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge-queue</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied-plat</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gorge-blanche</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mille-pieds</i>:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit fort</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</i>. Names, again, are given to
objects from some prominent feature with which they
are commonly connected: such are those taken from
garments; as, <i>blue-stocking</i>, <i>green-domino</i>, <i>a red-coat</i>,
<i>a blue-jacket</i>; cf. the use of <i>un cuirassier</i>. Other
names are transferred from one object to another
included in it: such as <i>the town</i>, for ‘the talk of the
town;’ <i>the smiling year</i>, for ‘the spring;’ <i>the cabinet</i>,
<i>the church</i>, <i>the court</i>, etc. Conversely, we find the idea
transferred from the object to its surroundings, as
in <i>the Round Table</i>, <i>the Porch</i>, <i>the Mountain</i>, <i>the
Throne</i>, <i>the Altar</i>, etc. Sometimes the name of a
quality is transferred to the person or thing possessing
the quality, as in the case of <i>age</i>, <i>youth</i>, <span class="nowrap"><i>plenty</i>:&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The people’s prayer, the glad diviner’s theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The young man’s vision and the old man’s dream,’<br /></span>
</span></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
as Dryden calls the Duke of Monmouth:<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> cf. also
<i>desert</i>, <i>bitters</i>. Other examples of this are&mdash;<i>his
worship</i>, <i>the Godhead</i>, <i>your highness</i>, <i>his majesty</i>, <i>his
excellence</i>, <i>his holiness</i>, etc. It will thus be seen that
collective names take their rise in this way as well as
the names for single persons or things; we can speak
of <i>their worships</i>, meaning the magistrates. But these
words do not always form substantives.</p>

<p>Nouns of action suffer the same transference as
names of qualities. By nouns of action we mean
names denoting activities generally, and conditions
which are derived from verbs, such as <i>overflow</i>, <i>train</i>,
<i>income</i>, <i>government</i>, <i>providence</i>, <i>gilding</i>, <i>warning</i>, <i>influence</i>.
In the instances given, the name of the action
has been transferred to its subject: but it is equally
capable of being transferred to its object, if ‘object’ be
taken in the widest sense. Thus, it may be transferred
to a consequence or result of the verbal activity:
such as <i>rift</i>, <i>spring</i>, <i>growth</i>, <i>a rise</i>, <i>assembly</i>, <i>union</i>,
<i>education</i>: or to an object affected by the activity, such
as <i>seed</i>, <i>speech</i>, <i>doings</i>, <i>lamentations</i>, <i>bewailings</i>, <i>resort</i>,
<i>excuse</i>, <i>dwelling</i>. Writings are denoted by the name
of their author; as, ‘Have you read Shakespeare?’ A
person is named after some favourite word of his own;
as, <i>Heinrich jasomir Gott</i>: ‘<i>Cedo alteram</i>’ (Tacitus,
Annals, book iii.):<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> animals are named from their
utterances, in nursery language, as a <i>bow-wow</i>; or from
those used to appeal to them, as a <i>gee-gee</i>: besides
these, we may add the names of such plants as <i>puzzle-monkey</i>,
<i>noli me tangere</i>, <i>forget-me-not</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The different kinds of change in meaning may
follow each other, and thus unite. Thus the word
<i>rosary</i> has on one side gained in comprehension, since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
it is now used of a necklace composed of beads employed
for a sacred purpose; but, on the other, it has lost
all connection with roses. A <i>horn</i> is a wind instrument
which may be, but is not commonly made of horn: the
name may equally apply to an instrument made of
other materials.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that some idea foreign to the
essence of a word, and connected with it merely by accident,
becomes absorbed into its signification as a mere
accessory: and this is then thought of as the proper
meaning, the primary meaning being forgotten: thus
names of relations of time and place gradually pass into
causal words; as, <i>consequence</i>, <i>purpose</i>, <i>end</i> (to the end
that), <i>means</i>, <i>way</i>.</p>

<p>Seeing that the unit of language is the sentence,
and not the word&mdash;in other words, that we think in
sentences,&mdash;it is natural that the change in meaning
should affect, not merely the separate words, but also
entire sentences. These sentences may receive a
meaning which is at the outset merely ‘occasional,’ but
which by repetition may become ‘usual’&mdash;a meaning
not implied by the combination of words as we hear it
for the first time. Take, for instance, such phrases as
<i>A plot is on foot</i>; <i>The business has come to a head</i>; <i>He has
come to the front</i>; <i>I have a man in my eye</i>; and such
combinations as the following, in which the word <i>hand</i>
plays a great part: <i>well in hand</i>, <i>off hand</i>, <i>hands off</i>, <i>at
hand</i>, etc. We cannot say that in these cases special
meanings of the word <i>hand</i> have developed: rather,
these meanings have become obscured by the attention
which we have come to pay to the phrase as a whole.
English is full of such terms of expression. In many of
these the sense can only be derived from the meanings
of the several words by the aid of an historical knowledge
of the language in which such combinations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
occur. Take such cases as, <i>to dine with Duke Humphrey</i>;
<i>to tell a cock and bull story</i>; <i>all his geese are
swans</i>; <i>to stuff one up</i>; <i>to give one the sack</i>; <i>to be half
seas over</i>: in French&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il raisonne comme un tambour</i>;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sot comme un panier</i> (for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un panier percé</i>); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">triste comme
un bonnet de nuit</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donner une savonnade</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire une
jérémiade</i>.</p>

<p>Language is incessantly engaged in an endeavour
to express the entire stock of ideas in the human
mind. But it is met by the difficulty, in the first
place, that the ideas of each individual in any society
differ widely from those of the other individuals in
the society: in the next place, by the difficulty that
the ideas of each individual are liable to a constant
process of expansion or contraction. The consequence
is that the ideas which language is constantly
endeavouring to express are necessarily coloured by
individual peculiarities; though it is equally true that
these peculiarities are unimportant in ordinary definitions
of the meanings of single words or groups of
words. For instance, it is no doubt true that the
word <i>horse</i> has the same meaning for everybody, in
so far as everybody refers it to the same object: but,
on the other hand, each man in his own particular
line, a hunter, a coachman, a veterinary surgeon, or a
zoologist will connect with the idea a larger quantity
of conceptions than one who has nothing to do with
horses. A father would be differently defined by a
lawyer and a physiologist: but the points which in the
thoughts of these make up the essence of paternity
are absolutely wanting to the consciousness of the
infant who uses the name of ‘father.’ The differences
in the judgments applied to feelings and ethics
are very great, and for obvious reasons. What different
individuals understand by <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i>, <i>virtue</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
and <i>vice</i>, is impossible to bring under one definition,
indisputable and undisputed.</p>

<p>The sum of the words at the disposal of any individual
connects itself with his ideas: and it thus
follows that the entire store of words forming the
stock of any community must adapt itself to the
whole stock of ideas belonging to any community,
and must change as these change. The meaning
of the words, again, must adapt itself to the standard
of culture attained from time to time by each nation.
New words must be created for new objects and new
relations and kindred, though novel meanings must
become attached to the old words&mdash;as in the case
of <i>steel pen</i>, properly, ‘a steel feather.’ And again,
a quantity of unobserved changes are constantly passing
on language which are hardly remarked as such,
and are the immediate result of a change in the whole
culture of a nation. Such are the words <i>humility</i>,
<i>talent</i>, <i>faith</i>, <i>spirit</i>, and the numerous other words
referred to before, to which Christianity has given a
deeper and more spiritual significance. Then, again,
progressive skill may have worked striking changes
in objects essentially the same: we call a Roman
trireme, a Chinese junk, and a British man-of-war by
the same name, <i>ship</i>; but we must admit that the
ideas attaching to it have changed considerably. And
thus it is with all objects capable of improvement by
skill, and again with purely mental or intellectual conceptions,
which change according to the changing conditions
of culture of the community which possesses
them.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="medium">ANALOGY.</span></h2>

<p>All the ideas consciously or unconsciously present
in the human mind are directly or indirectly connected
with one another. No thought, no conception, is so
independent of all others as not to suggest some other
idea or ideas in some way cognate or related. Thus,
for instance, if we think of the action of walking, it is
physically impossible not to call to mind, with more
or less distinctness, the idea of a person who walks.
And again, the idea of walking is likely also to evoke
the idea of some of the varieties of that action, which
we commonly indicate by such words as (to) <i>go</i>, <i>run</i>,
<i>step</i>, <i>stalk</i>, <i>stroll</i>, <i>stride</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Thus it is clear that our <i>ideas</i> associate themselves
into groups; and, as a natural result of this, the words
which we employ to express these ideas come similarly
to associate themselves in our minds.</p>

<p><i>Words</i>, then, which express related ideas, form
themselves into groups. Another source, though not
equally prolific, of such association, is similarity in
sound. Thus the word <i>book</i> may remind us of <i>brook</i>,
as it in fact reminded Shakespeare; the word <i>alarms</i>,
of ‘<i>to arms!</i>’ the word <i>hag</i>, of <i>rag</i> or <i>tag</i>; the word
<i>blue</i> may remind us of <i>few</i>. Such groupings are, however,
but very loose and ineffectual, unless a more or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
less close association (based on reality or fancy)
co-operates in order to make them strong and suggestive.
This may be seen by taking as examples the
associations existing between <i>brook</i> and <i>book</i>, <i>blue</i> and
<i>few</i>, on the one hand, and those existing between
<i>alarms</i> and ‘<i>to arms!</i>’ and <i>hag</i>, <i>tag</i>, and <i>rag</i>, on the
other. There is no similarity of meaning, no similarity
of contents between the words <i>book</i> and <i>brook</i>; the
association, therefore, in this case is a very loose one,
looser than that existing between <i>foot</i> and <i>boot</i>, for
instance. On the other hand, the connection between
the ideas of <i>alarms</i> and ‘<i>to arms!</i>’ is more obvious:
a sudden surprise, as in the case of an attack by an
unexpected enemy, might often be connected with
the idea of a call ‘<i>to arms!</i>’ Similarly, <i>hag</i> and
<i>rag</i> are ideas which often present themselves to our
mind in connection with one another, and consequently
the association between these two words is
stronger than that, for instance, existing between <i>hag</i>
and <i>flag</i>.</p>

<p>Correlation in the ideas, coupled with correlation
of their contents, especially if accompanied by similarity
of sound, makes the association most inevitable; and
the closer the correlation, or the greater the similarity,
the stronger will be the tie which binds the members of
the group.</p>

<p>It is necessary to the more exact classification of
these groups, that we should first obtain a clear conception
of the difference between what we may call the
<i>material</i> contents of a word, on the one hand, and the
<i>formal</i> or <i>modal</i> contents, on the other.</p>

<p>For this purpose, let us look at the two words
<i>father</i> (singular) and <i>fathers</i> (plural). Both these
words indicate a person or persons who stand in a
certain and well-defined blood-relationship to some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
other person or persons. This meaning, common to
both, we call their <i>material</i> contents. But the one
form is used to indicate <i>one</i> such individual; the other,
to indicate any number more than one. This, the
<i>unity</i> or <i>singularity</i> of the one, the <i>plurality</i> of the
other, makes up the <i>formal</i> or <i>modal</i> contents of each.
This <i>modal</i> part of the contents, in most of the languages
of the Indo-European stock, is left without
separate expression in the singular: in the plural,
however, it is generally expressed or indicated by
some change in form; this change being, in most
cases, made by the addition of some termination&mdash;in
the example we have chosen, by the addition of <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Before passing to another example, it is well to
point out that the <i>modal</i> contents of a so-called
“singular-form” by no means invariably imply unity;
nor, again, is the plural always, as in the case cited,
formed from the singular. In such a sentence as
<i>A father loves his child</i>, the idea expressed relates, or
may relate, to more than a single father; in fact, it
may be taken as a statement made correctly or incorrectly
of all fathers universally; and, with regard to
the second point mentioned, Welsh, among other
languages, has many words in which the plural is
expressed by the shorter collective form, and the
single individual is indicated by a derivative, e.g. <i>adar</i>,
birds; <i>aderyn</i>, a bird: <i>plant</i>, children; <i>plentyn</i>, a child:
<i>gwair</i>, hay; <i>gweiryn</i>, a blade of hay, etc.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>We can now come back to our point, and fix our
attention on two such words as (<i>I</i>) <i>speak</i> and <i>speech</i>.</p>

<p>Both these words evoke the thought of some well-known
and familiar activity called into play by our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
vocal organs. This constitutes the <i>material</i> contents
of both alike. The former, however, conveys the idea
that the action is being performed at the time the
word is uttered; the other is the name of the result or
product of that action. This, the <i>modal</i> part of their
contents, is left unexpressed; or, to speak more
accurately, we cannot divide the words so as to be
able to say that one part serves to express the <i>material</i>
contents, and another the <i>modal</i>,&mdash;a division which we
could make in the case of <i>fathers</i>, and which we might
make in, e.g., <i>speak</i>, <i>speaking</i>; <i>speech</i>, <i>speeches</i>; <i>book</i>,
<i>books</i>, <i>booklet</i>; etc.</p>

<p>It will now be clear that, among associations based
on correlation or on similarity of <small>IDEA</small>, this similarity
may exist between the <i>material</i> contents of the words
grouped together, or between their <i>modal</i> contents.
We therefore are now in a position to distinguish
between <small>MATTER-GROUPS</small> and <small>MODAL-GROUPS</small>.</p>

<p>To sum up, there exist association-groups based
<span class="nowrap">on&mdash;</span>

<span class="table">

<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell">both sound and meaning.</span>
</span></span>

These two latter classes (nos. 2 and 3) are subdivided,
as to the part of the meaning in which they
agree, into (<i>a</i>) <i>matter</i>-groups and (<i>b</i>) <i>modal</i>-groups.</p>

<p>Instances of all these are numerous, and will readily
suggest themselves; a few may suffice to illustrate
further what has already been said.</p>

<p>If we were to set down in a vertical column the
complete conjugation of some verb&mdash;say, of <i>to walk</i>,&mdash;and,
parallel to this, with equal completeness and in the
same order, the conjugation of the verbs <i>to write</i>, <i>to
go</i>, and <i>to be</i>, we should then have in our vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
columns four <i>matter</i>-groups. Taken horizontally, the
separate tenses would form so many <i>modal</i>-groups,
each divisible into smaller groups of singulars as
against plurals, or of first persons as against second
and third persons, etc. We should then, at the same
time, have illustrated the fact that in many cases
similarity of contents is accompanied by, or perhaps
we should say expressed by, similarity in sound, and
that it often happens that <i>similar change of modal
contents is accompanied by similar change in form or in
termination</i>.</p>

<p>Now, this fact, though far from holding good in all
cases, is of the greatest possible importance for the
development of language.</p>

<p>In order to realise this, let us for a moment suppose
a language in which no such ‘regularity’ held good:
in which ‘I love’ was expressed by <i>amo</i>; ‘thou
lovest’ by <i>petit</i>; ‘he loves’ by <i>audivimus</i>; and that
thus for every thought, every shade of meaning, every
<i>modal</i> variation of <i>material</i> contents, there existed a
new word in no way related to the others which indicate
associated ideas. The language would in this
case be more difficult of acquirement for those born in
the country where it was indigenous than Chinese
writing and reading is to the Chinese, and would
almost defy the efforts of a foreigner to master it.
Like the Chinese, the natives would only by dint of
long-continued study be in a position to collect a
scanty vocabulary, which, in the case of the foreigner,
would prove more scanty still. The picture here given
of such a language is, indeed, nowhere fully realised;
but some languages of savage tribes, in certain of their
features, approximate to the condition we have sketched.
Thus, for instance, in Viti, the <i>number</i> <small>AND</small> <i>the object
numbered</i> are expressed together in a single word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
varying for each number in each word; thus, <i>buru</i>
signifies ten cocoa-nuts, <i>koro</i> a hundred cocoa-nuts;
whilst <i>sclavo</i> signifies a thousand cocoa-nuts.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Strange and far-fetched as this method of forming
language may seem to us, and indeed is, it is after all
merely a much exaggerated example of what we find
in all modern languages, and, <i>e.g.</i>, in English, which,
side by side with the normal terminations to indicate
gender, as in <i>lion</i>, <i>lioness</i>, preserves such pairs as <i>bull</i>,
<i>cow</i>; <i>stag</i>, <i>hind</i>; <i>cock</i>, <i>hen</i>; etc.</p>

<p>Now, why should a language constructed on such
principles be so difficult to master as we have assumed
it to be? Or, to put the case differently, why should
a ‘regular’ language be more easily acquired than an
irregular one? To discuss this may seem superfluous;
but just as, in Algebra, some of the most important
theorems are deduced from a thorough discussion of
the principles of simple addition, so it will aid us in
language to have a clear grasp of this point, to possess
a full comprehension of the meaning of Analogy and
its influence.</p>

<p>In our hypothetical language, <i>every</i> word would have
to be acquired by a new and unaided effort of memory.
In actually existing languages, this is not the case.
Whether by precept or by observation, consciously or
unconsciously, whether in the process of acquiring our
own language in childhood, or in our study of a foreign
tongue, we associate not only <i>words</i> but also <i>parts of
words</i> with one another and with parts of <i>material</i> or
<i>modal</i> contents of our thoughts. A child that learns to
call a single book <i>book</i>, and more than one, <i>books</i>, and
to proceed similarly in a large number of cases, comes
unconsciously to connect the <i>s</i>, written or spoken, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the idea ‘many of them.’ The child attaches regularly
this sound or its symbol <i>s</i> to any word whose
plural it needs to express; and (perfectly correctly as
far as the logic of its case is concerned) says <i>one foot</i>
and <i>two foots</i>, after the model of <i>one boot</i>, <i>two boots</i>.
The child does not know that the form <i>foots</i> is contrary
to established usage, while the form <i>boots</i> is in harmony
with it; a series of corrections on the part of those
who know the established usages will gradually imprint
on its memory the usual form; but until this correction
has occurred sufficiently often, the form <i>foots</i> will recur
in the child’s vocabulary. The sound or symbol <i>s</i>, or
rather the habit of adding such a sibilant to a word or
words which state something about more than one
object, in order to denote plurality, leads sometimes
to its being used in cases where ‘correct’ grammar
omits it. A child will form words by a simple process
of analogy, which seem curious enough to us, but are
really quite simple and natural formations. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>
a little one spoke of <i>two-gas-lits</i>, on seeing two gas-jets
lit one after another; and&mdash;to add a parallel
instance of another frequent termination&mdash;another
child, when urged to ‘come on,’ replied, ‘I cannot
come quickerly.’</p>

<p>Such formations have been represented as the
result of a kind of problem in linguistic proportion,
somewhat like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Given the knowledge of the formation <i>soon</i>, <i>sooner</i>;
<i>large</i>, <i>larger</i>; etc., what is the value of <i>x</i> in the
<span class="nowrap">equation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell tdc"><i>Soon</i>: <i>sooner</i>: :<i>quick</i>: <i>x</i>?</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell tdc">Answer, <i>quicker</i>.</span>
</span></p>

<p>Next, given the knowledge of <i>large</i>, <i>largely</i>; <i>nice</i>,
<i>nicely</i>; etc., what then is the value of <i>x</i> which
<span class="nowrap">satisfies:&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell tdc"><i>Large</i>: <i>largely</i>: :<i>quick</i>: <i>x</i>?</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell tdc">Answer, <i>quickly</i>.</span>
</span></p>

<p>When combined, these two problems yield a compound
proportion sum, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell tdc"><i>Large</i>: <i>larger</i>  }<br />
<i>Large</i>: <i>largely</i> }</span>
<span class="tcell"> : : <i>quick</i>: <i>x</i>.</span>
</span></p>

<p>To this, the answer would be quickli-er or quick-er-ly,
and logically either answer is perfectly correct; they
only differ in the practically all-important, but logically
totally indifferent accident that the one happens to be
usual, while the other is opposed to the normal usage.</p>

<p>In order to fully realise how readily such forms,
whether ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect,’ may be coined, we
must likewise bear in mind that for the apprehension
of a child our divisions of sentences into words do not
exist at all. The sentences which a child learns to
understand are, at all events in the first instance, to
its conception one and undivided, nay, apparently indivisible
aggregates of sound, conveying somehow or
another a certain notion. The infant answers to such
a catena of sounds as <i>go-to-papa</i>, or <i>don’t-do-that</i>, and
<i>run-away</i>, long before it has the faintest conception of
the meaning of such sentences as, e.g., <i>go that way</i>. It
is only the incessant variations of the surroundings of
a <i>word</i>, while that combination of sounds itself remains
unaltered, which, by a <i>very</i> gradual process, brings to
our consciousness the fact that the whole sentence is
made up of separate elements, and enables us to
distinguish the <i>word</i> as an unit of expression. This
process, however, of the discovery of such units comes
about unconsciously and tentatively; whilst by all
children and many adult speakers the extent of meaning
attached to such units is very vaguely appreciated.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, in the linguistic history of each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
speaker, a period in which such a sound-group as, e.g.,
<i>noisier</i>, seems to consist as much or as little of <i>two</i>
words as the group <i>more noisy</i>, etc. The question
then presents itself, why, at a later period, we distinguish
two words in the latter group, while we continue
to regard the former group as one? The answer to
this is found in the fact that <i>both</i> the sounds, <i>noisy</i>
and <i>more</i>, are found to occur frequently alone or amid
totally different surroundings; they occur, however,
consistently maintaining the same meaning; whilst
of <i>noisier</i>, the first part only is used alone, and the
sound represented by <i>er</i>&mdash;whilst employed with many
other words to express a similar variation of idea&mdash;can
never, like <i>more</i>, serve independently to indicate that
variation, unaccompanied by the sound which expresses
the thought which it is desired to vary. And the
same remarks hold good for other cases.</p>

<p>It would, no doubt, be going too far to assert that
the usual division of words in our written language is
wholly fanciful and unnatural. But it is nevertheless
true that the division is not made in speaking, nor is
it always equally present in our consciousness while
we are uttering our thoughts. The less educated the
speaker&mdash;in other words, the less he has been taught
to bring reflection into play&mdash;the less active and operative
is this consciousness.</p>

<p>If, then, we represent the formation of such a word
as <i>quicker</i> in the shape of a solution of a proportion
problem, the identity between the linguistic and algebraical
processes must not be too closely insisted on.
Similarly, we must not exaggerate the idea of clearness
and distinctness present to the consciousness of
the speaker who expresses the idea ‘rapid in movement’
by <i>quick</i>, and a higher degree of rapidity in the
movement by the addition of the word <i>more</i> before it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
or <i>er</i> after it. The fact is that no comparison is an
absolute identity. Both our descriptions of the process
by which many of our words arise in our minds,
viz. the proportion, and the composition of the two
elements, are inexact in some respects; and in some
respects one, in other respects the other, will prove
less faulty. If in a formation like <i>quick</i>, <i>quicker</i>, it is
more likely that the two syllables in <i>quick-er</i> maintain
a certain independence of signification, still no such
explanation could possibly apply to such a form as
<i>brang</i>, heard from a child or a foreigner, instead of
<i>brought</i>. No simpler way of describing this process
can be found than the <span class="nowrap">equation&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sing</i> : <i>sang</i> :: <i>ring</i> : rang :: <i>bring</i> : <i>brang</i>.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moreover, this is doubtless the process adopted by
our reasoning in acquiring a foreign language. We are
taught that <i>To speak</i> is to be rendered by <i>parler</i>; <i>I
speak</i>, by <i>Je parle</i>; <i>I was speaking</i>, by <i>Je parlais</i>, etc.;
and our teacher expects (and naturally) that, possessing
this knowledge, we shall be able, when he proceeds
to inform us that <i>porter</i> means ‘to carry,’ to find the
as yet unknown and unheard forms <i>Je porte</i>, <i>Je portais</i>,
etc. At a later period, when we have read and spoken
the language frequently, we form many similar tenses
and persons of many verbs never or rarely encountered
previously; and no speaker could certainly affirm
whether he owes the utterance of the word to his
memory recalling it into renewed consciousness, or to
a process of automatic regulation by analogy after the
model of other similar and more familiar forms.</p>

<p>From the above examples it may be seen that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
analogy is productive, not merely of abnormal forms,
but also, and even to a larger extent, of normal forms.
The operation of Analogy, however, attracts most
attention when its influence leads to the formation of
unusual forms, and this fact has prevented due credit
being given to its full power and importance. It was
once usual to speak of all forms employed by any
speaker in conformity with normal usage as ‘correct;’
and of others, formed on the model of other examples,
but deviating from normal usage, as ‘incorrect;’ in
other words, as <i>mistakes</i>, or as formed <small>BY FALSE
ANALOGY</small>. From what we have said it will be clear
that this last term is wrong and misleading, and can
only be applied as expressing that the analogy followed
by the speaker in a certain case ought, for some reason
or another, not to have been accepted as the <i>norm</i>.</p>

<p>Analogy, then, in most cases acts as a <i>conservative</i>
agent in language by securing that its propagation and
its continuity shall be subject to some degree of regularity.
On the other hand, this very tendency to
promote regularity and uniformity often makes itself
felt by the <i>destruction of existing words or flections</i>
which deviate from a given goal; and it is mainly when
its destructive powers are manifest that its effects are
deserving of separate discussion.</p>

<p>So long as a speaker employs or a nation continues
to use the ‘correct’ form,&mdash;gradually, regularly, and
naturally developing it according to the regular laws
of phonetic change and growth to which it is subject
for the time being,&mdash;it is immaterial for the student
of language whether, in any particular case of the
employment of a word, this regularity is due to
memory or to analogy. It is when analogy produces
forms phonetically irregular that its operation becomes
of importance; and it is from the study of such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
‘novelties’ amongst its productions, that we can alone
derive full information about its nature. As long as
we find that the A.S. <i>stánas</i> remained <i>stánas</i>, or even
that this form was gradually changed into <i>stones</i>, we
are not tempted to call in the aid of Analogy, nor are
we challenged to prove its operation. Similarly, as
long as the plural of <i>eáge</i> remains <i>eágan</i>, or <i>eáge</i>
changes into <i>eye</i>, and forms its plural <i>eyen</i>, no temptation
presents itself to inquire into Analogy or its
operation. Even in this case, however, we cannot
help remarking that Chaucer might conceivably have
formed his plural <i>eyen</i> by analogy with other plurals
in <i>en</i>. But it is when the form <i>eyen</i> is replaced by
<i>eyes</i>, that we naturally inquire whence comes the <i>s</i>?
And since no phonetic development can change <i>n</i> into
<i>s</i>, we know that analogy with other substantive plurals
is and must be the reason of the appearance of this
otherwise inexplicable form. Thus the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mesure</i>
could and did become the English <i>measure</i>; but the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plaisir</i> could not, according to the laws of
phonetics, develop into <i>pleasure</i>. We can only explain
the latter form by assuming that it is founded on the
<i>analogy</i> of the older forms <i>measure</i>, <i>picture</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>We ascribe to Analogy those cases of change in
form of words, in syntactical arrangement, or in any
other phenomenon of language, such as gender, etc.,
where the existing condition has been replaced by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
something new modelled upon some pattern furnished
by other more numerous groups. Thus, for instance,
we find that the Latin feminine nouns in <i>-tas</i>, <i>-tatis</i>, have
developed French derivatives in <i>-té</i>, all of the feminine
gender. Why, then, is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">été</i> masculine, though equally
derived from a feminine Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstatem</i>? The answer
lies in the fact that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">printemps</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">automne</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hiver</i>,
being all masculine, the feeling set in that the ‘names
of the seasons’ should be masculine: just as names
of trees are feminine in Latin, and this possibly under
the influence of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbor</i>. Thus <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">été</i> followed the example
of the others, and was classed with them. The affinity
in signification here caused the difference in gender to
be felt as an incongruity, and the less strong came
to be assimilated to the stronger and more universal
type. Similarly, such words as <i>valeur</i> seem to have
become feminine after the analogy of Latin abstracts
in <i>-ura</i>, <i>-tas</i>, etc. In the former of these particular
instances we had to deal with a ‘<small>MATTER-GROUP</small>’ of
four cognate ideas, viz. ‘the seasons;’ in which group,
as three of the terms agreed in another accidental
peculiarity, viz. that of gender, this peculiarity was
imposed likewise upon the fourth member, so as to
produce a more complete uniformity in every respect.</p>

<p>In other cases we find, perhaps indeed more frequently,
<small>MODAL</small> groups thus extending their domain.
Thus the comparative forms, which nearly all end in
<i>er</i>, create the feeling that if a word expresses a comparative
degree it may be naturally expected to end
in <i>er</i>; and <i>more</i> from <i>mo</i>, <i>lesser</i> instead of <i>less</i>&mdash;nay,
even <i>worser</i> for <i>worse</i> is the result. In the case of
<i>more</i>, its very form led to the supposition that <i>mo</i>
was a positive form.</p>

<p>Similarly, the existence of the plurals in <i>s</i> in Anglo-Saxon,
aided no doubt by the frequency of <i>s</i> plurals in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
French, has caused this way of expressing the plural
to embrace almost all English nouns; or, at all events,
to embrace their formation to such an extent that
the older methods (such as vowel modification, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>mouse</i>, <i>mice</i>; <i>foot</i>, <i>feet</i>; formations in <i>en</i>&mdash;<i>ox</i>, <i>oxen</i>,
etc.) now appear as exceptions, themselves needing
explanation; and, again, as in the case of <i>more</i>, when
once the rule was formulated which laid down that
if a word expresses the plural it must end in <i>s</i>, the
conclusion was drawn that, if a word ending in <i>s</i> be
used as a plural, this <i>s</i> is the termination, and must be
omitted in the singular. It thus happens that to the
analogy of <i>fathers</i> as against <i>father</i>, <i>trees</i> as against
<i>tree</i>, etc., we owe the sets <i>Chinese</i> used as a plural noun
with its newly coined singular <i>Chinee</i>; <i>Portuguese</i>
with its singular <i>Portuguee</i>; <i>cherries</i> (Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cérise</i>),
<i>cherry</i>; <i>pease</i> (Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pisum</i>), <i>pea</i>. Nay, it is not even
always necessary that the <i>s</i> form be used in a plural
signification to cause the <i>s</i> to be ‘removed’ in order
to express the singular; <i>a raedels</i> was perfectly good
Old English, but as <i>two riddles</i> was right, the conclusion
was natural that <i>one riddles</i> was wrong. <i>Two
chaise</i> would not give offence, but it seemed natural
to write and say <i>one shay</i>.</p>

<p>The modal group, again, consisting of such formations
as <i>despotism</i>, <i>nepotism</i>, <i>patriotism</i>, etc., created
the feeling that <i>tism</i> was the correct ending instead
of <i>ism</i>, and so has manifested a tendency to supplant
it. Thus the correcter form <i>egoism</i> has made way
for <i>egotism</i>. Thus it is to the <i>pianist</i>, <i>machinist</i>,
<i>violinist</i>, that the <i>tobacconist</i> owes his <i>n</i>, to which he
has no right; he ought, properly speaking, to appear
as <i>tobaccoist</i>.</p>

<p>The most widely reaching result of the operations
of analogy is where <i>modal</i> and <i>matter</i> groups, in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
cross classifications, unite to cancel irregularities created
in the first instance by phonetic development. Thus
the Anglo-Saxon form <i>scæd</i> (neuter) exists side by
side with another form, <i>sceadu</i> (feminine). The Gothic
form <i>skadus</i> proves the latter to belong to the <i>u</i>
declension. But even in Anglo-Saxon this declension
was but sparingly represented, most words originally
belonging to it being declined according to the far
more common scheme of words, like <i>stán</i>, stone; <i>dóm</i>,
doom, etc.; others varying in their declensions between
the feminines whose stem ended in <i>wâ</i>, or like those
in <i>â</i>. In both these declensions the nominative ended
in <i>u</i>; an example of the <i>wâ</i> declension <span class="nowrap">being&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nom. <i>beadu</i>, Gen. <i>beadwe</i>,<br /></span>
</span></span>

and of the <i>â</i> declension&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nom. <i>giefu</i>, Gen. <i>giefe</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

Our word <i>sceadu</i> long oscillated between these two
paradigms, and we consequently meet with a Gen.
sing. <i>sceade</i>, as well as an Acc. plur. <i>sceadwa</i>. This
termination, where <i>w</i> was maintained, developed into
our present termination <i>ow</i>, seen in <i>shadow</i>; whilst the
form <i>shade</i> is, properly speaking, a nominative form.
Analogy, however, depending upon other nouns in
which all cases in the singular had become identical
in form, caused the form <i>shadow</i> to be used in the
nominative as well as in other cases, and extended
the use of <i>shade</i> over those cases which were declined.
Similarly, the two forms <i>mead</i> and <i>meadow</i> are due, the
one to a nominative, the other to the inflected cases
of the same word, the A.S. <i>mǽd</i>. In these cases
both forms survived, and the meanings became slightly
differentiated; it more frequently happens that one
succumbs. Thus the A.S. Nom. plur. of the pronoun
for the second person <i>gé</i> developed into <i>ye</i>, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
inflected case <i>éow</i> into <i>you</i>. The latter has now almost
completely ousted the once correct nominative <i>ye</i>,
which survives only in dialects or in elevated language,
where, in its turn, it frequently supplants the accusative
and dative <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>The regular development of preterite and past
participle in many verbs, together with the dropping
of the prefix <i>ge</i>, which in several Teutonic languages
has become specialised as a mark of that participle,
caused both these forms to converge into one. This
has in its turn been the cause why, in the case of
many verbs, where regular phonetic development kept
preterite and participle asunder, one of these forms
was made to serve for both.</p>

<p>The A.S. verb <i>berstan</i> was, in its preterite, conjugated
<span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span>

<span class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell">Indic.</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>Bærst</i></span>

<span class="tcell"><i>bursten</i></span>
</span></span>

and its past participle was <i>borsten</i>. Thus the <i>u</i> was
present in four of the six forms in the indicative, and in
six subjunctive forms. The first effect of the operation
of Analogy was to abolish this useless and cumbersome
irregularity, and the <i>u</i> supplanted the <i>æ</i>, not
long after this <i>æ</i> had become <i>a</i> (<i>barst</i>). Then the
process set in which we explained above, and the past
part. <i>borst (en)</i> was replaced by <i>burst</i>.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply these instances <i>ad
infinitum</i>. Enough has, however, been said to explain
the working of Analogy and to show how wide its
application is. The student who has mastered this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
sketch, should proceed to study carefully the corresponding
chapter in Paul’s ‘Principles of Language,’
and the pamphlet, cited above, by Professor Wheeler,
where many illustrations will be found taken from
English and many other languages. One of the main
points which are clearly brought out in the latter
work is that the phenomena of folk-etymology show
that these groupings are effectual in modifying form
only in so far as a supposed likeness of contents or
idea is associated (erroneously) with the resemblance
of form.</p>

<p>Before concluding our remarks, we must, however,
add a few words on the operation of Analogy where it
works neither as a conservative nor as a destructive
agent, but simply as a <small>CREATIVE</small> one.</p>

<p>In the cases hitherto discussed, the forms called
into being have survived to the prejudice of older
material which perished for lack of vitality. In the
struggle for existence it succumbed. A new form, in
order to survive, had necessarily to replace some
unusual and inconvenient older one, or it was a necessary
condition that several speakers, for some other
reason, should concur in creating the same novel form.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
That ‘irregular’ forms should continue to exist in the
case of some of the commonest verbs, and in the pronouns,
is explicable by the fact that these words occur
with sufficient frequency to gain enough strength to
resist innovation. The frequency of their occurrence
induces familiarity. Any new form which some innovating
speaker might create on the basis of some
analogy is, in those words, too strongly felt as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
novelty; the speaker too frequently hears or reads the
‘correct’ form to permit the survival of the new candidate
for general usage. The novelty is a ‘mistake,’
remains a ‘mistake,’ and succumbs in the struggle for
existence. Frequency of use in the case of any particular
word <i>may</i> assist its phonetic development and
increase its impulse in that particular line, and its rate
of speed on the road to phonetic decay:&mdash;this is as
yet, however, a point of dispute among philologists,
and a question which claims attention from all students
of language. But there can be no doubt that the more
frequent the occurrence of any particular form in
ordinary speech, the more capacity it must gain for
resisting the levelling tendencies, the absorbing
influence of other more numerous but less common
groups. It is, however, not true that all the offspring
of Analogy is thus exposed to the struggle for existence.
Where new ideas are to be expressed, Analogy guides
us in our choice of terms, and even where the idea is
not strictly new, but no term for it exists in the
vocabulary or in the memory of a community, or even
in that of the majority of such community, the new
form will be adopted with little reluctance; nay, often
without being felt as a new creation at all. In this
way the language is always being enriched by new
forms created on the analogy of existing ones. Where
many instances might be given, a few will suffice.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
The termination <i>y</i> of <i>mighty</i>, <i>guilty</i>, etc., was added to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
the nouns <i>earth</i>, <i>wealth</i>, etc., to form <i>wealthy</i>, <i>earthy</i>,&mdash;nay,
even used to form such hybrids as <i>savoury</i>, <i>spicy</i>,
<i>racy</i>. After the model of <i>kingdom</i>, <i>heathendom</i>, etc.,
were formed <i>princedom</i>, <i>popedom</i>, etc. The group
<i>winsome</i>, <i>blithesome</i>, etc., gave birth to <i>venturesome</i>,
<i>meddlesome</i>, etc.; and whilst <i>sorrowful</i>, <i>thankful</i>, <i>baleful</i>,
<i>shameful</i>, are found in A.S., no such antiquity can
be claimed for <i>blissful</i>, <i>youthful</i>, <i>faithful</i>, <i>merciful</i>,
<i>respectful</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It has been well remarked<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> that a perfect grammar
would be one which admitted no irregularities or
exceptions; and if all the operations of Analogy in
forms and syntax could be thoroughly mastered and
reduced to rule, exceptions and irregularities would be
far less common than they are.

of language. The <small>SENTENCE</small> is <small>THE SYMBOL WHEREBY
THE SPEAKER DENOTES THAT TWO OR MORE CONCEPTIONS
HAVE COMBINED IN HIS MIND</small>; and is, at the
same time, the means of calling up the same combination
in the mind of the hearer. Any group of words
which accomplishes this is a sentence, and consequently
<small>A SENTENCE NEED NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN A FINITE
VERB</small>, as is sometimes alleged. In Latin, and in the
Slavonic languages, the word answering to <i>is</i> is very
commonly suppressed; and in Latin epistolary language
whole sentences appear in which no copula
occurs. Such combinations as <i>Omnia præclara rara</i>;
<i>Suum cuique</i>; are perfectly intelligible. In English
we often employ sentences like <i>You here?</i> <i>I grateful
to you!</i> <i>This to me!</i> <i>Your very good health!</i> <i>Long
life to you!</i> <i>Three cheers for him!</i> <i>Why all this
noise?</i>&mdash;and, again, such proverbs as <i>Oak, smoke</i>; <i>Boys,
noise</i>; <i>Ash, splash</i>: and these are just as much sentences
as <i>The man lives</i>.</p>

<p>Language possesses the following means of expressing
and specialising such combinations of <span class="nowrap">ideas:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The simple juxtaposition of the words corresponding
to the ideas; as, <i>All nonsense!</i> <i>You coward!</i>
<i>Away, you rogue!</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>(2) The order of the words; as, <i>There is John</i>, as contrasted
with <i>John is there</i>; <i>John beats James</i>, as
against <i>James beats John</i>.</p>

<p>(3) The emphasis laid upon these words; as in
‘Charles is <i>not</i> ill.’</p>

<p>(4) The modulation of the voice; as when <i>Charles is
ill</i> is stated as a mere assertion, and ‘Charles
is <i>ill</i>?’ in which case the same words are turned
into an interrogative sentence by the mere
change of pitch during the utterance of the
last word.</p>

<p>(5) The time, which commonly corresponds with the
emphasis and the pitch; the words in the previous
sentences which are emphasised or spoken
in a higher pitch respectively, will be found to
occupy a longer time in utterance than the
words composing the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p>(6) Link-words, such as prepositions, conjunctions,
and auxiliary verbs.</p>

<p>(7) The modification of words by inflection, in which
(<i>a</i>) the inflectional forms may, without other aid,
indicate the special kind of combination which
it is desired to express, as in <i>patri librum dat</i>;
<i>his books</i>; <i>father’s hat</i>: or (<i>b</i>) the connection
between the words may be denoted by formal
agreement; as, <i>anima candida</i>, <i>la bonne femme</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The method of combining ideas by means of link-words
and inflections is one which could only have set
in after a certain period of historical development, for
inflections and link-words are themselves of comparatively
recent appearance in language; the other
methods, on the contrary, must have been at the
disposal of speakers from the very first development
of language. It should, however, be noticed that 2-5
inclusive are not always consistently employed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
represent simply the natural ideas as they present
themselves, but are capable of a traditional development
and, consequently, conventional application. For
instance, in the Scandinavian languages the method of
intonation is a purely artificial one;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and in Chinese,
homonyms are distinguished by lowering or raising the
voice.</p>

<p>In Chinese the tones are five: a monosyllable may
be uttered with (1) an even high tone; with (2) a
rising tone, as when we utter a word interrogatively;
with (3) a falling tone, as when we say, <i>Go!</i>&mdash;with (4)
an abrupt tone, as of demand; or with (5) an even low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
tone. These are the tones of the Mandarin dialect,
which is the language of the cultivated classes; and,
in their application, they are limited by euphonic laws,
so that they cannot all be used with all syllables.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The idea, or the nature of the combination intended
to be expressed by the speaker, need not be completely
represented by words in order to render fully intelligible
the thought present in the mind of the speaker.
Much less than a complete expression will often suffice.</p>

<p>If a sentence is the means of inducing a certain
combination of at least two ideas in a hearer’s mind, a
complete sentence must necessarily consist of at least
two parts. We shall later discuss those sentences in
which only one of the two parts is expressed in words,
and shall here confine our attention to the complete
sentence. Grammar teaches us that a complete sentence
consists of a subject and a predicate. Now, these
grammatical categories are undoubtedly based upon a
psychological distinction; but we shall soon see that it
does not necessarily follow that the grammatical and
psychological subject, or the grammatical and psychological
predicate are always identical. The <small>PSYCHOLOGICAL
SUBJECT</small> expresses the <i>conception which the
speaker wishes to bring into the mind of the hearer</i>;
the <small>PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICATE</small> indicates <i>that which he
wishes him to think about it</i>. This, and no more
than this, is required to impart to any collection of
words the nature of a sentence.</p>

<p>In grammar we commonly attach a much more
restricted meaning to the terms ‘subject,’ ‘predicate,’
and ‘sentence.’ For instance, when the predicate is
a noun, we demand that the normal sentence should
express the comprehension of the subject in a wider
class; as, <i>John is a boy</i>: or that it should express
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
some quality of the subject; as, <i>John is good</i>: or, lastly,
that the subject be identical with the predicate; as,
<i>John is King of England</i>. But in reality we have,
in many sentences, noun-predicates which show us
relations of quite another kind, expressed by the
mere collocation of subject and predicate, as in many
proverbs and proverbial expressions; e.g., <i>One man, one
vote</i>; <i>Much cry and little wool</i>; <i>First come, first served</i>;
<i>A word to the wise</i>; <i>Like master, like man</i>; <i>Better
aught than naught</i>; <i>Small pains, small gains</i>. This
is the way in which children make themselves intelligible;
as, <i>Papa hat</i>, for <i>Papa has a hat on</i>: and this is
the way in which even adults endeavour to express
their meaning to foreigners when the latter have not
mastered more of the language than perhaps a few
nouns, viz. by mentioning the objects which they wish
to bring under the notice of their companions, and
trusting to the situation to enable these to understand
their meaning. We say, <i>Window open</i>, and we are
understood by the foreigner to mean that the window
is open, or that we wish it open, as the circumstances
may show.</p>

<p>Originally, there was only one method of marking
the difference between subject and predicate, viz.
stress of tone; as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the instance which we just
gave, of ‘Window open.’ If these words are pronounced
with a great stress on ‘window,’ we at once
perceive them to mean, The thing which is (or which
I wish to be) open is the <i>window</i>. If, on the other
hand, we exclaim, ‘Window <small>OPEN</small>,’ with stress on
‘open,’ we at once convey the sense, The window
is (or must be) <i>open</i>, not closed. This shows that,
in the case of such isolated instances, the psychological
predicate has the stronger accent, as being
the more important part of the sentence, and the part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
containing the new matter. Again, the place held in
the sentence by the subject and predicate respectively,
may have afforded another means of distinction
between the two. Different views have been held as
to the respective precedence of subject and predicate
in the consciousness of the speaker. The true view
seems to be that the idea of the subject is the first to
arise in the consciousness of the speaker; but as soon
as he begins to speak, the idea of the predicate, on
which he wishes to lay stress, may present itself with
such force as to gain priority of expression, the subject
not being added till afterwards. Take, for example,
the opening of Keats’ <span class="nowrap">Hyperion&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Deep in the shady sadness of a vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat grey-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone.’<br /></span>
</span></span>

In this case, the superior emphasis gained by the
position of the predicate in the first place causes
the speaker to set it there, and is indicative of the
superior importance which he attaches to it.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the subject is sometimes expressed first
by a pronoun, whose relation only becomes clear to
the listener when expressed more definitely at a later
period; <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘She is coming, my dove, my dear.’<br /></span>
<span class="author">(Tennyson, Maud.)<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She dwelt among the untrodden ways<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside the springs of Dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A maid whom there were none to praise<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And very few to love.’<br /></span>
<span class="author">(Wordsworth, The Lost Love.)<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She was a staid little woman, was Grace.’<br /></span>
<span class="author">(Dickens, Battle of Life.)<br /></span>
</span></span>

This construction is extremely common in French;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
as, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle approche, cette mort inexorable;’ ‘Mais ce
qu’elle ne disait point, cette pauvre bergère.</span>’</p>

<p>The transposition, then, of subject and predicate
may be considered an anomaly; but it is an anomaly
of frequent occurrence, and is based on the importance
which the predicate assumes in the mind of the speaker.</p>

<p>We have seen that single words may possess
concrete and abstract significations,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and it is the same
with sentences. A sentence is concrete when either
the psychological subject or the psychological predicate
is concrete; as, <i>This man is good</i>. But as far as
the mere form goes, concrete and abstract sentences
need not differ; for instance, an expression like <i>The
horse is swift</i> (which, when it does not refer to any
particular horse, is an ‘abstract’ sentence) is identical
in form with the expression <i>The horse is worthless</i>,
which obviously refers to some particular horse, and
is therefore ‘concrete.’ It is the situation and circumstances
alone which mark the different nature of
the sentences. There are, however, sentences which,
with a concrete subject, have a partially abstract
meaning. If, for instance, on hearing a lady sing,
one remarks, <i>She sings too slowly</i>, the sentence is
entirely concrete; but the same words may be used
to express that the singer is in the habit of singing too
slowly, in which case the predicate becomes abstract.
Such sentences may be called ‘concrete abstract.’</p>

<p>It was stated that at least two members are
necessary to make up a sentence. It seems, at first
sight, a contradiction to this statement that we find
sentences composed of merely a single word, or of
a group of words forming a unit. The fact is that,
in this case, one member of the sentence is assumed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
and finds no expression in language. Commonly this
member is the logical subject. This subject may,
however, be completed from what precedes, or is
sufficiently clearly indicated by the circumstances of
the case; or, again, in conversation, it is often necessary
to take it from the words of the other speaker.
The answer is frequently a predicate alone; the
subject may be contained in the question, or the whole
question may be the logical subject. If I say, <i>Who
struck you?</i> and the answer is <i>John</i>, the subject is,
in this case, contained in the question, and the answer
is, ‘The striker is John.’ If I say, <i>Was it you?</i> the
whole question is the logical subject, and the answer,
<i>Yes</i>, <i>No</i>, <i>Certainly</i>, <i>Surely</i>, <i>Of course</i>, etc., is the
logical predicate, as if the reply had been, ‘My being
so is the case.’ Many other similar words may serve
as the predicate to a sentence spoken by another,
such as <i>Admittedly</i>, <i>All right</i>, <i>Very possibly</i>, <i>Strange
enough</i>, <i>No wonder</i>, <i>Nonsense</i>, <i>Stuff</i>, <i>Balderdash</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In other cases, the surrounding circumstances, or
what is called ‘the situation,’ forms the logical subject.
If I say, ‘Welcome!’ and at the same time stretch
out my hand to a new arrival, this is equivalent to
saying, <i>You are welcome</i>, and <i>welcome</i> is the logical
predicate. In exclamations of sudden astonishment
and alarm, such as <i>Fire!</i> <i>Thieves!</i> <i>Murder!</i> <i>Help!</i> it
is the situation which is the logical subject. Challenges
are instances of the same kind, e.g. <i>Straight on or not?</i>
<i>Right or left?</i> <i>Back or forward?</i> When the poet
<span class="nowrap">sings&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘A wet sheet and a flowing sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A wind that follows fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And fills the white and rustling sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And bends the gallant mast,’<br /></span>
</span></span>

<i>the situation</i>, again, is the logical subject.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>It should be noticed that, in the case of sentences
expressed by a single member, the word which for
the speaker is the psychological predicate becomes
for the hearer the subject. A man, seeing a house
on fire, cries ‘<i>Fire!</i>’ for him <i>the situation</i> is the
subject, and the idea of <i>fire</i> is the predicate. The
man who hears ‘<i>Fire!</i>’ cried before he himself sees
it, conceives of <i>fire</i> as the subject, and of <i>the situation</i>
as the predicate. Sentences may, however, occur in
which both speaker and hearer apprehend what is
uttered as the subject, and the situation as the predicate.
Supposing, for instance, that two persons
have agreed that the fire shall be extinguished before
they go out, and one of them, observing the chimney
smoking, cries out, ‘The fire!’ in this case the fire,
the logical subject, is alone denoted, and the predicate
is gathered by the person addressed from the situation,
which is evident from the speaker’s gestures. If,
again, two friends are travelling, and one remarks that
the other is without his umbrella, the mere exclamation,
‘Your umbrella!’ suffices to make the latter
complete the predicate. The vocative, again, pronounced
as such, and intended to warn or entreat,
suggests a psychological predicate which it lacks in
words. On the other hand, by the side of a verb in
the second person without subject pronoun, the vocative
may be apprehended as the subject to the verb. If I
say, ‘Come!’ the vocative (the person addressed) may
be apprehended as the subject to this verb; if it be
Charles, the meaning is, <i>Charles should come</i>.</p>

<p>It is a question much disputed, and not yet decided,
whether impersonal verbs should be regarded as
lacking a subject or not. If we regard the grammatical
form alone, we cannot doubt that sentences
like <i>It snows</i>, <i>It freezes</i>, <i>It is getting late</i>, have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
subject. But there is no reason for alleging that this
subject (<i>it</i>) can be treated as a logical subject; a
logical subject must admit of a definite interpretation,
and it is difficult to give one in this case. Again, in
the case of impersonal verbs, like the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pluit</i>, the
Greek ὕει, the Sanscrit <i>varśati</i>, (it rains), and the
Lithuanian <i lang="lt" xml:lang="lt">sninga</i> (it snows), the formal subject <i>may</i>
be found in the ‘personal’ termination, which is
supposed to be the remnant of a word signifying <i>he</i>,
<i>she</i>, or <i>it</i>. And it seems natural to recognise a formal
subject in this case, but, at the same time, to notice
that this formal subject stands apart from the psychological
subject. It seems probable that an older stage
of language existed, in which the bare verbal stem
was set down; just as in Hungarian at the present
day, where the third person of the present singular
has no suffix, the first and second terminating in <i>-ok</i>
and <i>-s</i> respectively. In Anglo-Saxon we find passive
and other impersonal verbs used absolutely, without
any subject expressed or understood; thus, <i>þám ylcan
dóme e þé démoð eów byð gedémed</i> (= With the same
judgment that ye judge, to you (it) shall be judged);
<i>him hungrede</i> (= N.H.G. es hungerte ihn).<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The
psychological subject is, then, as little expressed in
the sentence <i>It is hot</i>, as in the sentence <i>Fire</i>.
But although it is not expressed, it would be unsafe
to assume its non-existence, for here, as well as everywhere
else, we have two ideas conjoined, in the same
way as when we exclaim, <i>Fire!</i> In this case there
is, on the one side, the perception of a concrete
phenomenon; on the other, the abstract idea of
burning or of fire: and just as that perception is
brought by our exclamation under the general idea
of burning, so in the statement <i>It rains</i>, the perception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
of what is going on is by our words ranged under
the general notion of water falling in drops from the
sky. Our conclusion, therefore, is this: sentences like
<i>Fire!</i> as well as those like <i>It rains</i>, have both
psychological subject and predicate; but in the former
case no subject is expressed, whereas in the latter
<i>a formal</i> subject is employed, which, however, does
but imperfectly, if indeed at all, correspond to the
psychological one. This holds good unless we conceive
of the formal subject, <i>It</i>, as standing for that
which we see or that which is happening now. In
this case, the peculiar nature of the impersonal verbs
would be restricted to the difficulty, but not the
impossibility, of explaining their subject.</p>

<p>We have defined the sentence as the expression for
the connection of two ideas. Negative sentences may
seem, at first sight, to contradict this, since they denote
a separation. But the ideas must have met in the
consciousness of the speaker before judgment can be
pronounced whether they agree or disagree. In fact,
the negative sentence may be defined as the statement
that the attempt to establish a connection between the
ideas has failed. The negative sentence is, in any
case, of later date than the positive, and though, in
all known languages, negation now finds a special
expression, it is possible to imagine that negative
sentences might be found in some primitive stage of
language, wherein the negative sense was indicated
by the stress alone and the accompanying gestures.
Cf. such sentences as ‘<i>I</i> do this?’ or ‘Eine ego ut adverser?’
(Ter., And., I. v. 28.)<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> At all events sentences
of assertion and sentences of demand border on each
other very closely, and can be expressed by the same
forms of language. The different shades of meaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
attaching to the words can be recognised only by the
different tones conveying the feeling meant to be
indicated.</p>

<p>Wishes and demands, again, touch each other very
closely; and it is natural to suppose that, in an early
state of linguistic consciousness, a wish would have
been equivalent to a demand. A sentence like ‘Heads
up!’ expresses a demand or wish, but it might equally
convey an assertion. We can say perfectly well, ‘<i>They
entered, heads up</i>,’ or ‘<i>erect</i>;’ and we hear quite commonly,
<i>Heads up!</i> meaning, ‘Hold your heads up!’
And indeed such sentences of demand, or imperative
sentences, would naturally be the first to present themselves
to primitive mankind, whose utterances, like
those of children nowadays, would naturally take the
shape of requests that their immediate needs might be
satisfied. We employ many such sentences at the
present day, such as <i>Eyes right!</i> <i>Attention!</i> <i>Hats
off!</i> <i>This way!</i> <i>All aboard!</i> <i>Joking apart</i>; <i>An eye for
an eye</i>; <i>Peace to his ashes!</i> <i>A health to all good lasses!</i>
<i>Away with him!</i> <i>Out with him!</i> Then, again, there
are sentences composed of a single linguistic member;
such as <i>Hush!</i> <i>Quick!</i> <i>Slow!</i> <i>Forward!</i> <i>Up!</i> <i>Off!</i>
<i>To work!</i></p>

<p>Two kinds of interrogatory sentences must be
distinguished: (1) those that put in question <i>one only</i>
of the members of which they are composed, and (2)
such as contain nothing affirmative, but are <i>purely</i>
interrogatory in their nature. No satisfactory names
have as yet been given to these two classes, but a
study of one or two examples will show that the
difference is real, and will tend to illustrate it. Such
a sentence as <i>Who has done this?</i> or <i>Where did you
get that?</i> no doubt asks a question as to the name
of the doer of a certain deed, or the place where a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
particular object was obtained, but, at the same time,
certainly assumes that the interrogator takes for granted
that a certain deed was done by some one, or a certain
object obtained by the person addressed. In fact, the
form of the interrogation is to some extent affirmative.
No such affirmation, however, is present in such
questions as <i>Can you speak French?</i> <i>Will you come?</i>
<i>Have you money?</i> etc.</p>

<p>Of these two classes of questions, the former are
certainly of the more recent origin, for they demand
the employment of an interrogative pronoun or adverb,
with which the latter can dispense. It is noteworthy
that in I.E. languages these interrogative words are
at the same time indefinite; and it is hard to decide
which of the two meanings should be regarded as the
original. On the one hand, it is easy to conceive how
a word bearing an interrogative meaning could assume
an indefinite one. If we are accustomed to employ
the word <i>who</i> when we wish to know who a person is,
but are uncertain, we may easily proceed to apply this
word in a case where we are uncertain (or wish to
appear so), though we do not ask for information. <i>A
who-person has done this</i>, is not and has never been an
English method of expressing, ‘Some one has done
it.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> But it is conceivable that, at some stage of the
I.E. languages, our linguistic ancestors may have
adopted a similar mode of expression. On the other
hand, it is as easy to imagine that a word expressive
of uncertainty, or absence of knowledge or information,
should be used to indicate the desire for it. In fact,
we actually do employ a method akin to this when we
use the indefinite <i>any</i> to show that we desire to know;
<i>e.g.</i>, if, upon entering a dark room, we ask, <i>Any one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
here?</i> This, of course, is not, and never has been, in
English, equivalent to ‘<i>Who</i> is here?’&mdash;but still it is
quite conceivable that at some early linguistic period
this transition has actually been made. Could it be
demonstrated that it ever actually was made, the transition
from the questions in our second category, to
those falling under our first, would be explained. For
suppose the question <i>Is any (one) here?</i> (an order of
words to which we now are bound, but which, as we
shall see, was not always the necessary order) to be
put as <i>Any (one) is here?</i> the proximity of this
sentence to <i>Who is here?</i> is at once evident.</p>

<p>Questions with an interrogative pronoun stand
nearer still to questions with an indefinite pronoun
where a negative answer is expected, as appears when
we set <i>What can I answer?</i> by the side of <i>Can I
answer anything?</i>&mdash;<i>Who will do this?</i> by the side of
<i>Will any one do this?</i>&mdash;<i>Where is such a man?</i> by the
side of <i>Is there such a man?</i> The question to which
the simple answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ is expected is in
many languages expressed by a special particle. Thus
<i>ne</i> in Latin serves to mark an interrogation, and the
stress is laid upon the word to which the interrogative
particle is affixed. At present, the Teutonic and
Romance languages almost universally express interrogation
by the order of the words; but this inverted
order by no means necessarily involves interrogation,
and in former times was very frequently employed in
affirmative clauses. Thus, for instance, in <span class="nowrap">A.S.&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Ne hýrde ic cymlîcor ceól gegyrwan:’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not heard I comelier keel to have been prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">= I never heard ... (Beowulf, 38).<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Saegde se ðe cûðe’ (ibid., 90):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said he that knew = He ... said.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Waes seó hwíl micel’ (ibid., 146):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the time great = The time was long.<br /></span>
</span></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Even now we have many interrogations in which the
stress or tone alone marks their nature; as, <i>Any one
there?</i> <i>All right?</i> <i>Ready?</i> <i>A glass of beer, sir?</i>
(spoken by a waiter). We can thus conceive it
possible that, for a long time, sentences may have
existed without any sign except the tone to indicate
their interrogative nature.</p>

<p>Simple interrogative sentences hold in some ways
a middle position between positive and negative
sentences of assertion. They may, in fact, be thrown
into a positive or a negative form at choice; the
positive form naturally presenting itself as the simpler,
while the function of the negative form is to modify
the question pure and simple. Such modifications
may, indeed, cause the interrogation to take something
of the character of the sentence of assertion. We
may, for instance, mention a fact and expect it to be
confirmed by another. In this case, we may employ
a negative interrogatory sentence; as, <i>Were you not
there? I thought I saw you!</i> Or we may employ a
positive interrogatory form of sentence, showing by
the tone of query alone the nature of the sentence; as,
<i>You were there, I think? You are quite happy?</i> We
thus see, by examples taken from both the positive
and negative side, how nearly the sentences of interrogation
touch the sentences of assertion.</p>

<p>Another way in which sentences of interrogation
and assertion approach one another is in the expression
of admiration or surprise. To express such feelings
we may employ either (1) the interrogative or (2)
the assertive form of sentence, marking the latter,
however, by a tone expressive of interrogation. Thus
we may say, <i>Is Francis dead?</i> or express the same
idea by saying, <i>Francis is really dead?</i> emphasising
the word <i>really</i> and raising the voice at the last word.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Thus, too, we can ask the direct question, <i>Are you
here again?</i> or employ the assertive form, <i>You are
here again?</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Sentences expressive of surprise without a verb,
may be classed either with the interrogative form, or
with the assertive form with the interrogatory tone.
They occupy a neutral ground between the two. Thus,
<i>You my long lost brother?</i> <i>What, that to me?</i> <i>What,
here already?</i> <i>So soon?</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> And infinitival clauses are
similarly used; as, <i>I to herd with savage races!</i> <i>etc.</i>
(Tennyson, Locksley Hall); <i>Mene incepto desistere
victam?</i> (Vergil, Æneid, I. 37). This use is very common
in French; cf. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moi vous abandonner!</i> (Andrieux);
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et dire qu’à moi seul je vins à bout de toutes ces
prévisions!</i> (Daudet). We find, also, expressions of
surprise in which the psychological subject and
predicate are connected by ‘and:’ <i>So young and so
worn out?</i> <i>A maid and be so martial?</i> (Shakespeare,
1 Henry VI., II. i.).<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The expression of surprise is
sometimes weakened into a mere conventional formula
for opening a conversation; as, <i>Always in good spirits?</i>
<i>Busy as always?</i> <i>Busy yet?</i></p>

<p>The primitive form of expression without any
finite verb is especially common in the indignant
repudiation of an assertion; as, <i>I a liar?</i> ‘She ask <i>my</i>
pardon?’ <i>How! not know the friend that served you?</i>
<i>Ego lanista?</i> <i>Io dir bugie?</i></p>

<p>What is vaguely known as the rhetorical class of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
questions arises from a desire, on the part of the
interrogator, to make the person addressed reflect
upon and admit the truth of information indirectly
contained in the interrogation. Such are the questions
in some catechisms, and those in the ‘Guide to Knowledge;’
e.g., <i>Do not mulberry trees often bear two crops
of leaves in a year?</i> <i>Must not every substance be prepared
before it receives the colour?</i> This use of the interrogation
and interrogative form is, of course, of much more
recent date than the other common usages.</p>

<p>The foregoing consideration of the sentence in its
simplest form, as consisting of simple subject and
predicate only, will have prepared us for the study of
the development of all other syntactical relations from
this the only primitive one. For all other extensions
of the sentence&mdash;with the single exception of the
copulative union of two simple ones&mdash;arise from
the repetition of the relation between subject and
predicate.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The copulative extension is now commonly
indicated by means of conjunctions or other particles;
<i>e.g.</i>, ‘John wrote <i>and</i> Alfred was reading:’ but even
now mere co-ordination is sufficient; as, <i>John wrote,
Alfred read</i>; <i>He came, he saw, he conquered</i>; <i>One
rises, the other falls</i>; <i>Men die, books live</i>; etc. It is
therefore easy to imagine that, at one time, this mere
juxtaposition, which seems to us an exceptional usage,
may have been the regular one.</p>

<p>Among the other extensions, two main cases are
to be distinguished, as either (1) two equivalent members
combine in the same clause with another (<i>i.e.</i>
two subjects with one predicate, or two predicates
with a single subject); or<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> (2) a combination (<i>a</i>) of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
subject and predicate becomes, as such, the <i>subject</i> or
predicate of some other word or combination (<i>b</i>),
which latter is then the <i>predicate</i> or subject to (<i>a</i>) the
former.</p>

<p>It is not easy to illustrate these extensions by
instances drawn from modern English: nay, it is
impossible if we insist upon invariably framing
sentences which the present state of our language
would regard as admissible. But we must remember
that we are now attempting to trace the probable
development of our syntactical relations, or rather of
our method of expressing the various syntactical
relations, as it proceeded during a very primitive stage
of the history of language. At this period the speakers
were struggling to find intelligible utterance for their
thoughts, which were themselves but primitive, confused,
childish. All the examples which we have
given heretofore should be regarded therefore merely
as illustrating processes common in very remote linguistic
periods, and not as instances of what is usual
at the present period. We have found it necessary on
previous occasions to illustrate our arguments by
combining English words in a way which is not and
has never been English,&mdash;the advantage of such
illustration being that it aided us to understand, at
least in a certain measure, the mode in which our
linguistic ancestors of ages long past thought. To
this artifice we shall find it necessary to revert somewhat
largely, as the analytical character of modern
English, with its necessarily fixed order of words, has
effaced most traces of this primitive state of language.</p>

<p>We should have an instance of the first main case
of extension mentioned if, after saying, e.g., <i>John
reads</i>, we remembered that <i>Alfred</i> too was reading,
and then merely added this second subject. We have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
shown that we must not suppose that <i>originally</i> the
order of the words was, as is now invariably the case
in modern English, (1) subject, (2) verb: so that
<i>John read</i> (without inflection, <i>read</i> being a mere name
of the action) was just as correct as <i>read John</i>, but
not more so. If we clearly grasp this, we can fully
understand that such a combination as <i>John read
Alfred</i> (or, indeed, <i>John, Alfred read</i>) might once
have been intelligible for what we should now express
by <i>John and Alfred are reading</i>.</p>

<p>Similarly, a little linguistic imagination will suffice
to enable us to conceive of the production by those
primitive language-makers of a sentence like <i>Sing</i>(ing)
<i>John dance</i>(ing) to express <i>John sings and dances</i>.
Such constructions of two equal parts in combination
with a third might be symbolised. Thus we might
put <i>s</i> for subject, <i>p</i> for predicate, then the symbolisation
would run <i>sps</i>, <i>ssp</i>, <i>psp</i>, or <i>spp</i>, etc., or <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>a</i>.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>In the first fictitious example, the two subjects
stood <small>BOTH IN PRECISELY THE SAME RELATION</small> to the
predicate, and in the second the two predicates stood
in exactly the same relation to the subject. In such
cases, the facts may be described just as correctly and
just as completely by a sentence consisting of two
parts only, viz., a compound subject, consisting of the
two joined by a copula, + the predicate (or subject +
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
compound predicate). Of these two modes of expression,
closely allied as they are, the one appears to us
strange and, indeed, impossible,&mdash;the other so familiar
that we can hardly imagine a state of language in
which both alike may have been regular. On the
other hand, we have no difficulty in seeing how the
two systems have become confused.</p>

<p>All traces, therefore, of the construction which we
have now lost are interesting and worth studying. A
sentence like Cicero’s <i>Consules, prætores, tribuni plebis,
senatus, Italia cuncta a vobis deprecata est</i> (= Consuls,
prætors, tribunes of the plebs, the senate, all Italy
implored of you) is constructed much upon the model
of the method now obsolete. In this case, however,
the construction seems to us less unnatural,
because the subject last named in the sentence, viz.,
<i>Italia</i>, may be considered to include all the others and
to stand alone in their stead: hence it is that we find
the verb in the singular, and hence the feminine
gender of <i>deprecata</i> (implored). In another passage
Cicero says, <i>Speusippus et Xenocrates et Polemo et
Cantor nihil ab Aristotele dissentit</i>. This would be a
perfect instance of <i>ssp</i> were it not for the insertion of
<i>et</i>, which (due, as it is, to confusion with the compound
subject in the sentence consisting of two parts only)
would lead us to expect that the verb would be placed
in the plural. It is, however, precisely this fact that
the verb stands in the singular which demonstrates
that it belongs as predicate to each subject separately,
and not to the group indicated by the enumerated
subjects jointly. In M.H.G. we meet with such constructions,
especially those where <i>one</i> part&mdash;as the
subject, for instance&mdash;is placed <i>between</i> the two others;
as, <i>Dô spranc von dem gesidele her Hagene alsô sprach</i> =
‘Then sprang from the seat hither Hagen thus spoke.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
In A.S., too, we find occasionally a somewhat similar
construction, as in Beowulf, 90-92: <i>Saegde se ðe cúðe
... cwæð ðæt se Ælmihtiga</i> = ‘Said he who knew ...
spoke that the Almighty.’ If we change the order,
and add <i>and</i>, we transform this sentence into one of
two parts: <small>SUBJECT</small>, <i>he who knew</i>; <small>PREDICATE</small> (compound),
<i>said and spoke</i>. Even in modern language
this construction is not wholly without parallels. Cf.
<i>Another love succeeds, another race</i> (Pope, Essay on
Man, iii., line 130); cf. also, <i>Dust thou art, to dust
returnest</i> (Longfellow).</p>

<p>Or, again, we find sentences where the two equal
parts both follow or both precede. <i>He ðæs frófre
gebád, wéox under wolcnum, weorðmyndum ðáh</i> (He
received consolation [compensation], grew up under
the clouds [= on earth], increased in fame) (Beowulf,
7); <i>He weepeth, wayleth, maketh sory cheere</i> (Chaucer,
Canterbury Tales, 3618); <i>Is Bushy, Green, and the
Earl of Wiltshire dead?</i> (Shakespeare, Richard II.,
Act III., ii., 141); <i>Of ðære heortan cumað yfele
geðancas, mannslyhtas, unriht-hæmedu, forligru, stale,
léase gewitnyssa, tællíce word</i> (Matt. xv. 19).</p>

<p>But it is also quite conceivable that (<small>REMEMBERING
THE EXTENDED MEANING WHICH, FOR THE PRIMITIVE
STAGE OF LANGUAGE, WE MUST ATTACH TO THESE
TERMS</small>) two subjects should come into the consciousness
as related to the same predicate, even though
that <small>RELATION</small> is <small>OF</small> a very <small>DIFFERENT NATURE</small> in the
case of the one from that in the other. To illustrate
this, let us remember that the noun must once have
been uninflected, or, at least, no definite system of
inflection had been evolved; the verb had a much
vaguer and less definite meaning than at present; the
order of words had not yet begun to be significant;
that <i>John strike</i>, as well as <i>strike John</i>, or words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
equivalent in meaning, could stand for <i>John strikes</i>,
or <i>John has been striking</i>; nay, even, if only accompanied
by appropriate gestures, for <i>John was struck</i>,
or <i>John is being struck</i>.</p>

<p>Even at present, in the case of a verb like <i>to smell</i>,
the relation between the subject and predicate differs
essentially when we say, <i>I smell the flower</i>; or, <i>The
flower smells</i>. An effort on the part of our linguistic
imagination is again needed, but the effort need not be
very difficult, in order to enable us to realise that in a
sentence like <i>John smell flower</i>, or <i>John strike Alfred</i>,
<small>BOTH</small> nouns may once have been felt as standing in
the subject relation to the predicate; so that, again, in
the latter sentence, gestures or circumstances were
needed in order to make it clear who was the acting
subject and who the suffering subject, whereas, in the
former sentence, no such confusion could arise.</p>

<p>If we take a sentence like ‘Give him a book,’ we
feel both the person and the thing as <i>objects</i> of the
action; and observation of this fact will enable us
further to understand still more clearly that, at an
older period of language, two subjects may have stood
in the same sentence with the same predicate, though
the relation between them and that predicate was not
the same. It may further aid us to understand how,
when once one of these subjects had developed into
the grammatical category of <small>OBJECT</small>, the possible relations
of such objects were so varied that the differentiation
into various grammatical categories of accusative,
dative, etc., becomes intelligible and natural.</p>

<p>The object, when once developed, may and often
does become, by the nature of its relation to the predicate,
a mere limitation or definition of such predicate,
instead of remaining a member of the sentence equivalent
in importance and weight with the subject, as it is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
<i>e.g.</i>, in such sentence as <i>John strikes Alfred</i>: whilst
in a sentence like <i>John runs a mile</i>, the object is a
mere attribute to the predicate, and the sentence can
no longer be looked upon as tripartite, but must be
regarded as consisting of two parts, <i>i.e.</i> (1) the subject,
and (2) the predicate with its extension. These two
cases, however, are not separated by any clear line of
demarcation.</p>

<p>And just as the predicate may receive such a
defining word, so may the subject and the object
developed from it. These now commonly occur in
the shape of attributes, whether substantival or adjectival,
and genitives of substantives; as, <i>The cattle are
the farmer’s best</i>; <i>The cattle are beautifully fat</i>. This
could not be expressed at all in languages which have
as yet developed no inflections: these could merely
employ the defining word in juxtaposition to the word
defined; as, in Chinese, <i>T’su sin heu sin t’u ye</i>, literally
meaning ‘Origin Sin prince Sin spring <i>final part</i>,’ <i>i.e.</i>
‘Originally the prince of Sin sprang from Sin,’ <i>i.e.</i>
‘was born of a woman of the Kingdom of Sin.’ The
fact that the determinant attached to the subject is
not a predicate can then only be discovered by the
presence of a third word which is detached from the
two words that together make up the subject by a
greater stress or, it may be, by a slight pause. Thus,
if we say, <i>liber pulcher</i>, it is impossible to say whether
<i>pulcher</i> is a predicate or merely the attribute to <i>liber</i>,
unless we add some verb like <i>est</i> or <i>habetur</i>, or unless
the custom of the language leads us to apprehend
<i>pulcher</i>, from its position, as a predicate.</p>

<p>In truth the determinant, in this case ‘pulcher,’ is
nothing but a degraded predicate, uttered not so much
for <i>its own</i> sake, <i>i.e.</i> for the information it conveys, as
in order to assign to this group of subject and determinant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
a further predicate, which predicate then conveys
the real information; as, <i>Liber pulcher nobis gaudio
est: Hæc res agetur nobis, vobis fabula</i> (Plautus,
Captivi, Prologue.)</p>

<p>We have stated that the determinant is merely a
degenerate or degraded predicate. The meaning of
this statement may be most easily apprehended from
cases in which the finite verb is affected by this
degeneration, so that of the two predicates one might
be logically replaced by a relative sentence; as, <i>There
is a devil haunts thee</i> (Henry IV., Pt. I., Act II., iv.);
<i>I have a mind presages me</i> (Merchant of Venice, I. i.);
<i>He groneth as our bore lith in our stie</i> (Chaucer, Canterbury
Tales, 7411); <i>And was war of a pistel stood
under a wal</i> (Tale of Gamelyn); <i>I’ll have none shall
touch what I shall eat</i> (Massinger, City Madam, I. i.);
<i>I can tell you news will comfort you</i> (ibid., III. i.);
<i>The price is high shall buy thy vengeance</i> (Middleton,
Spanish Gipsy, V. i. 443).</p>

<p>A similar construction was found in the older
stages of the Romance languages; cf. O.Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non vi
rimasse un sol non lacrimassi</i> (‘There remained none
did not cry’); O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Or n’a baron ne li envoit son
fil</i> (‘There is no baron does not send him his son’).
Nor must we suppose that this construction is one
peculiar to the Indo-European languages, and entirely
inherited from an early stage in their development.
Its use in Teutonic languages becomes more general
towards the end of the Middle Ages than before that
time. But even in Semitic languages like Arabic, we
meet with expressions such as ‘I passed by a man
slept.’</p>

<p>In the above instances, we have seen that the
finite verb could sink into the position of a mere
attributival determinant. In other words, in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
sentence as ‘There is a devil haunts thee,’ the very
words show that the important word, in which the
chief information lies, is <i>devil</i>, while the verb <i>haunts</i>
might almost as well be expressed by an adjectival
attributive, as ‘haunting.’ It is plain that if a verb
could thus easily lose its predicatival character, a predicate
bearing no distinguishing marks of its verbal
character could, with even more facility, be similarly
degraded. The border-land between <i>meus</i> in ‘liber
meus’ (= the book is mine) and <i>liber meus amittitur</i> is
a very narrow one.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to distinguish between the
various functions of the determinant&mdash;the differences
in which, however, commonly remain undenoted by us
by any corresponding verbal difference, though they
are, logically speaking, of the greatest importance.
The determinant may leave the extent of the subject
untouched; in other words, the epithet may apply to
all the objects or ideas which the substantive by itself,
or limited as it is by other circumstances, denotes: this
is the case in <i>mortal man</i>; <i>the almighty God</i>. On the
other hand, it may serve to restrict the meaning of the
substantive; as when we say, <i>old houses</i>, <i>an old house</i>, <i>a</i>
(or <i>the</i>) <i>son of the king</i>, <i>the journey to Paris</i>, <i>Charles
the Great</i>. Similarly, if we say, <i>the old house</i>, meaning
to contrast it with <i>the new one</i>, it is obvious that we
individualise the meaning of <i>house</i>: while the expression
would come under the first head in a sentence
like <i>Lo, the place where I was born! Humble as it is, I
love the old house</i>. In the latter class of instances, the
determinant must be expressed, because without it the
predicate is meaningless or untrue. If we say, <i>A
journey obliges us to cross the channel</i>, we ascribe by
these words to all journeys what is true of some only,
<i>e.g.</i>, of a journey to Paris. In the first category, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
considering the epithet, we may notice that it may
already be known as commonly attached to the word to
which it is appended, as in <i>This red wine</i> (the speaker
holding it up) <i>I prefer to many more expensive ones</i>; or
it may tell us something new, as in the case of <i>That
poor man has no children</i>, where the sentence without
<i>poor</i> would state the same fact, the word <i>poor</i> conveying
additional information. In this case it approaches the
nature of a true predicate, and we often employ a
relative sentence to express it: thus, instead of saying,
<i>Poor Charles has had to emigrate</i>; if we wished to
emphasise the adjective, we should say, <i>Charles, who
was poor</i>, <i>etc.</i> Again, the determinant need stand in no
direct relation to the predicate, as in our above example,
where the fact that the man has no children is
independent of his being poor; but it may also stand
to the predicate in the relation of cause and effect, as
in <i>The cruel man would not listen to his victim’s prayers</i>,
where the determinant ‘cruel’ is applied <i>owing to</i> the
fact mentioned in the predicate.</p>

<p>We have now seen that attributes are degenerated
predicates. There are sentences in which the determinant
has, as yet, a somewhat greater independence
than is the case with the ordinary attributes, and which,
therefore, may be said to represent a transition
stage. In a sentence like <i>He arrived safe and sound</i>,
the determinant <i>safe and sound</i> is still predicate, in the
wider sense of the term, to <i>he</i>, but subordinate to the
other predicate <i>arrived</i>, which alone in present grammar
would bear this name. <i>Safe and sound</i> are, <small>IN COMPARISON
WITH</small> <i>arrived</i>, a mere attribute to <i>he</i>, and
nowadays such determinants are, for the linguistic
consciousness, what has been very correctly termed
<small>PREDICATIVE ATTRIBUTES</small>. These are distinguished
from ordinary attributes by a greater freedom in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
place they may occupy in the sentence, and thereby
manifest their greater independence.</p>

<p>Predicative attributes are very frequently, but not
always, adjectives: we might, <i>e.g.</i>, replace the one in
our example by a prepositional phrase like <i>in safety
and in good health</i>. In Modern High German, where
the attributive adjective is declined in agreement with
its noun, the near affinity of this construction to the
predicate shows itself in the use of the uninflected form
of the adjective as in the case of the predicate. Thus
we say, <i>Er is gesund nach Paris gekommen</i>: just as we
say, <i>Er ist gesund</i>.</p>

<p>When once all these various determinations have
been developed from original subjects or predicates,
the sentence may become further complicated, (1) by a
combination of a determined and a determining element
becoming determined by a new element,&mdash;as in <i>All good
men</i> (i.e. <i>good men</i> + <i>all</i>); <i>John’s eldest daughter</i> (i.e.
either <i>eldest daughter</i> + <i>John’s</i> or <i>John’s daughter</i> +
<i>eldest</i>, according to circumstances); <i>He falls easily into
a passion</i>,&mdash;to be understood, <i>He falls into a passion</i> +
<i>easily</i>: (2) this combination may itself serve as a determinant,&mdash;as
in <i>Very good children</i> (i.e. <i>children</i> + <i>very
good</i>); <i>An all-sacrificing love</i> (i.e. <i>a love</i> + <i>all sacrificing</i>);
<i>He speaks very well</i> (i.e. <i>He speaks</i> + <i>very well</i>); or (3)
several determining elements may be joined to one
determinate,&mdash;as in <i>Bad gloomy weather</i>; <i>He walks
well and fast</i>: or (4) several determinate elements may
be joined to a single determinant, just as several
subjects may be joined to one predicate, or several
predicates to a single subject,&mdash;e.g., <i>John’s hat and
stick</i>; <i>He hits right and left</i>.</p>

<p>These constructions are not always distinctly
separable: for instance, a phrase like <i>big round hats</i>
may be understood as <i>hats that are big and that are</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
<i>also round</i> (constr. No. 3,) or we may take it as <i>round
hats that are big</i> (constr. No. 1). Though the results
of both constructions would be the same, the ways in
which these results are obtained are logically distinct;
just as the result of 3 × 5 is identical with 5 × 3, though
the genesis of that result varies according as we have
groups of five and take three of such groups, or as
there are groups of three and we put five of them
together.</p>

<p>We have now considered the simple sentence and
its extensions according to the formula <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>a</i> (see
p. 110) in all their bearings and consequences. We
said, however, that besides extensions on this plan,
there were others in which some combination of subject
and predicate became itself the predicate or subject
to another member of a sentence.</p>

<p>This we may symbolise by (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>a</i>.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>We here enter on the ground covered by the complex
sentence; but if the reader has understood what
has been already said, he will see that, if we consider
this division into simple and complex sentences from
a historical and psychological point of view, no clear
line of demarcation is to be found. It is indeed true
that, as long as we agree that no set of words shall be
called a sentence unless it contains a finite verb, a
definite criterion exists. If, however, we fully realise
that a combination of noun and adjective, for instance,
is as much subject and predicate as noun and verb
(cf. <i>homo vivus</i> with <i>homo vivit</i>), we shall likewise feel
that ‘The good man lives’ is a complex sentence, one
predicate of which has degenerated: it must accordingly
be admitted to differ in degree, but not in kind,
from ‘The man who is good lives’, where, again, the
complexity is of precisely the same nature as in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
phrase <i>round straw hats</i>, if we were to say, for
instance, ‘Round straw hats are pretty, but round felt
hats are ugly.’</p>

<p>Combinations on the plan (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>a</i> are common
enough: <i>I think you are mistaken</i>; <i>The doctor saw I
was not well</i>; <i>Remember you owe me sixpence</i>: in which
cases the subject and predicate (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) serve as object
to another predicate.</p>

<p>There are, however, other constructions conceivable
which would be more strictly conformable to the
scheme; such as <i>I owe you sixpence is true</i>, or <i>You
are in danger grieves me</i>; where we now use the so-called
conjunction <i>that</i>, which is originally a pronoun
standing as a repetition or a resumption of the subject&mdash;‘<i>That</i>
I owe you sixpence is true’ being originally
‘I owe you sixpence; <i>that</i> is true.’</p>

<p>To find such constructions as <i>I owe, etc., is true</i>
in actual use, we must go back to older stages of
language, <i>e.g.</i>, to Hans Sachs, the German shoemaker&mdash;poet&mdash;dramatist
(1494-1576), who framed such
sentences as <i>A couple (man and wife) lived in peace
for seventy years vexed the devil</i>, for <i>A couple lived, etc.,
and this vexed, etc.</i>;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> <i>The afflicted woman stabbed herself
tells Boccaccio</i>. In the former of these the sentence
is subject, in the latter, object. A sentence (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)
serving as actual predicate we might illustrate by remembering
that in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imperator felix</i> may mean
‘The emperor <i>is</i> happy,’ and then using <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imperator
qui capite est operto</i> for the emperor’s answer in the
well-known anecdote&mdash;‘The emperor <i>is</i> he who has
his hat on his head.’</p>

<p>Remembering this, and always carefully remembering
the extended meaning of the terms subject and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
predicate, we realise that in the common construction
like <i>You are always grumbling, a bad habit</i>, we
have really, in the so-called apposition <i>a bad habit</i>, a
predicate.</p>

<p>In this way we can follow up the development of
the sentence from its simplest to its most complex
form. After thus studying the hypotaxis in all its
bearings, we need only touch briefly on the subject
of parataxis.</p>

<p>Though, of course, it may occur that we have reason
to make in immediate succession two or more statements
which are absolutely independent of one another,
this will be naturally rare; and, when it happens, we
are not likely to combine these statements into one
compound clause. Even in the nearest approach to
such a case, where we enumerate different but analogous
or contrasting facts, the sentences are not absolutely
disconnected and independent: cf. <i>She is crooked,
he is lame</i>. Here, undoubtedly, more is expressed by
means of the parataxis than the mere enumeration of
the two facts; an additional significance being given
to each by the very analogy between the two cases.
Similarly in <i>He is laughing, she weeps</i>, where the contrast
is an additional fact expressed by the coupling of
the sentences. Still, the approach to independence is
here undoubtedly very close. We already depart a
step further from mere co-ordination in the case where&mdash;in
grammatically absolutely identical manner&mdash;two
or more sentences are co-ordinated in a story; as, e.g.,
<i>I arrived at twelve o’clock; I went to the hotel; they
told me there was not a single room to be had; I went
to another hotel</i>, etc., where each sentence to a certain
extent expresses a cause or defines the time of occurrence
of the fact which is mentioned in the next.
Now, though this additional meaning is clearly there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
it is a meaning which at the moment of uttering each
clause is not necessarily, nay not probably clearly present
in the speaker’s mind: we might more fully and perhaps
more correctly, though undoubtedly very clumsily,
express the course of thought by: <i>I arrived ..., and
when I had arrived, I went ..., but when I had gone
to the hotel, they told ..., and because they told ...
I went to another, etc.</i></p>

<p>We have, then, in our example a combination of independence
with interdependence which is the first
step on the road towards subordination of one member
to the other.</p>

<p>Instead of the clumsy method of repetition which,
if ever, is of course but very seldom employed, we
give partial expression to this mutual relationship by
demonstrative pronouns or verbs. (1) <i>I arrived ...,
then I went ..., there they told ..., etc.</i> (2) <i>I met a
boy; he told me....</i> (3) <i>He bought a house; that was
old.</i> (4) <i>He told a lie; that was a pity.</i> A careful
study of these examples,&mdash;in the third of which the
demonstrative pronoun refers (as in the second) to one
part only of the preceding sentence, whilst in the
fourth it relates to the whole statement made in the
former part,&mdash;will show (<i>a</i>) the method of development
of demonstrative into relative pronoun; (<i>b</i>) that of
demonstrative pronoun into conjunction&mdash;<i>It was a pity
that he told a lie</i>; (<i>c</i>) the concomitant change from
parataxis to hypotaxis&mdash;from <i>He bought a house</i>, +
<i>that (house) was old</i>, to <i>He bought a house that was old</i>
= ‘which was old.’</p>

<p>A peculiar kind of paratactical subordination occurs
where an imperative or interrogative clause loses its
independence and becomes an expression of condition;
e.g., <i>Go there yourself</i>, (<i>and</i> or <i>then</i>) <i>you will see that
I am right</i>, or <i>Do you want to do it? then make haste</i>.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="medium">CHANGE OF MEANING IN SYNTAX.</span></h2>

<p>We have considered, in Chapter IV., the different ways
in which words change their meanings: and have remarked
that change of meaning consists in the widening
or narrowing of the scope or application of each
word. We wish, in this chapter, to point out that
these processes are not confined to words, but that
whole syntactical combinations are constantly undergoing
changes of meaning of a similar nature. It may
be well to give at the outset an instance illustrative
of such difference. Let us take the sentence, ‘The
book reads like a translation.’ In this sentence the
meaning which we attach to the word <i>book</i> has developed
from that attached to A.S. <i>bóc</i>, a beech tree.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The word <i>read</i> has been specialised in meaning from
the more primitive signification ‘to interpret.’ In the
same way, <i>translation</i> meant originally nothing more
than a <i>transference</i> of any kind, but has been specially
applied to a transference of the ideas expressed by one
language into those of another. Such, then, are examples
of changes of meaning which have occurred in
words.</p>

<p>But besides these changes, it is obvious that we
have here a sentence in which the relation between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the subject and predicate differs considerably from that
which is the <i>usual</i> one. We do not in the aforesaid
sentence mean to say that the subject <i>book</i> performs
the action <i>reads</i>, but we wish to assert that the subject
is of such a nature as to admit of some person performing
the action in question. This usage of the
subject and predicate, though, when employed circumspectly,
it need cause no obscurity, yet is an
exceptional usage, or, as we have elsewhere called it,
an <i>occasional</i> one. Such a construction might, however,
easily spread, and become habitual or <i>usual</i>. In
that case we should have to admit that the meaning of
the general syntactical relation between subject and
predicate connected by a verb in the active voice had
widened in extent, and contracted in content. Instead
of stating that the subject <i>does</i> the action, we should
now have to adapt the statement to the wider but
more indefinite relation&mdash;the subject either <i>does or admits
of</i> the action. We shall have occasion to return
to these and similar phrases later on.</p>

<p>Now let us take the phrase ‘He reads himself into
the mind of his author.’ In this case we shall find
that the meaning of <i>reads</i> is the same as that which we
usually attach to it; the peculiar meaning lies not in
the separate words, but in the phrase taken as a whole.
The particular, <i>occasional</i> use of the accusative <i>himself</i>,
together with the combination of the words, is what
expresses the whole thought implied; and thus we
have here an instance of a specific construction in
which the force of the accusative connected with the
word is different from the force of the case in more
common usage. Though the application of the accusative
in the way we have just mentioned must originally
have been an <i>occasional</i> one, yet the phrase, though it
has indeed become specific, has become so common,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
that we may <i>in this combination</i> call its meaning <i>usual</i>.
We have, then, in studying change of meaning in
syntactical relations, besides the classification of <i>occasional</i>
and <i>usual</i>, another <i>distinction</i> to draw; that
between (<i>a</i>) a change of meaning in a general relation,
without reference to the individual terms which happen
to stand in that relation (such as subject and predicate,
verb and object, noun with accompanying genitive, preposition
and its régime), and (<i>b</i>) a change in meaning
of a case, or other syntactical relation, with regard to
a specific word or expression, in connection with which
it has come to express a new shade of thought. These
two classifications are independent of each other, and
cross one another. It is further to be noticed that,
just as it is impossible to draw a hard and fast line of
distinction between the <i>occasional</i> and <i>usual</i> in the
meaning of a word, so it is impossible to always clearly
formulate when the change in meaning of a syntactical
relation is <i>general</i> or <i>special</i>; nay, it would in many
cases be difficult to decide whether a change of meaning
in a group of words is owing to a change of meaning
in the words, or in their syntactical relations. Yet
it is necessary to keep the distinction in view.</p>

<p>Instances of these syntactical changes are common
in all languages. We might take, as a simple instance,
from the Latin, the syntactical change which is brought
about in the relationship of the transitive verb and
its accusative. Transitive verbs commonly take the
accusative of the direct object; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Grecia capta ferum
victorem cepit</i>. But many words not originally transitive
become so when composed with a preposition; as,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accedere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præcellere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transgredi</i>, just as <i>to forego</i> in
English is transitive, while <i>to go</i> is intransitive. This
construction was then felt as <i>usual</i>. But besides
these we find a quantity of verbs strictly intransitive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
employed with the accusative; as, <i>ambulare maria</i>, (to
walk the seas: Cicero, de Finibus, ii. 34); <i>ludere
Appium</i> (just as we say, <i>to play the fool</i>: Cicero, ad
Quint. Fratr., ii. 15); <i>saltare Cyclopa</i> (to dance the
Cyclops dance: Horace, Sat. I. v.); <i>stupere donum</i>,
(Vergil); etc. It was felt that the relationship between
<i>ambulare</i> and <i>maria</i>, e.g., was closely enough related to
that of <i>regere currum</i> on the one hand, and to that of
<i>ambulare super maria</i> on the other, to enable analogy
to become widely operative in extending this use. The
result was that some of the constructions passed into
regular usage; some stood out longer, and must always
have appeared as exceptional or occasional; as, <i>sudare
mella</i> (Vergil, Eclogue iv. 30).</p>

<p>One of the most ordinary changes brought about
by relations in syntax is that due to the relationship of
what is commonly called the governing word and its
case. The signification, for example, borne by an
accusative standing in the relation of object to a verb
may cause the verb to bear a meaning more special
than its ordinary meaning. Thus, in the case of such
a phrase as <i>I beat</i>, it is clear that in <i>to beat a dog</i>, <i>to
beat the enemy</i>, <i>to beat the air</i>, different values are
attached to the meaning of the word ‘(to) beat,’ and
the word thereby is narrowed in its definition and correspondingly
enriched in its contents. It seems natural
to examine a little more in detail the relationship borne
by the cases to the word which governs them: there
seems no objection to the use of the word <i>governs</i>, provided
only that it be understood with due limitations;
that certain particular forms are commonly devoted to
the expression of certain ideas or relationships, and
that the idea be not entertained that there is anything
in the nature of the meanings of the words indissolubly
connected with a particular form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>To deal with the <i>Cases</i> first. It is impossible to
set together the different uses of the genitive, and to
draw from these by induction any certain proof of the
functions which this case fulfilled in the primitive Indo-European
languages. For instance, the use of the
genitive when it depends on verbs seems to have
nothing in common with that of the same case when
connected with substantives. In the former case, for
instance, in the Classical languages, we find merely
a few isolated instances of the genitive regularly
governed by verbs, especially those verbs which signify
<i>ruling over</i>, <i>remembering</i>, <i>lacking</i>, etc. The genitive
with nouns, on the other hand, seems most probably to
have been used in Indo-European for the expression
of any relation between two substantives, as indeed it
was in classical Greek, and, to a less extent, in Latin;
cf. such different usages as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæsaris horti</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docendi
gratia</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reus Milonis</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbis instar</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">me Pompeii esse scio</i>
(Cicero, Fam., ii. 13); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Germanicus Ægyptum proficiscitur
cognoscendæ antiquitatis</i> (Tacitus, Annals, xi. 59);
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hoc præmii</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut adhuc locorum</i> (Plautus, Captivi, 382).
In modern English, on the contrary, the function of the
genitive in connection with substantives is greatly restricted.
Many usages possible in Anglo-Saxon are at
the present day obsolete; for instance, <i>Criste is</i> <small>ALLRE</small>
<i>kinge king</i> (Orm., 3588), <small>MÁDMA</small> <i>mænigo</i> (Beowulf, 41),
<i>ðaer wæs</i> <small>MÁDMA</small> <i>fela</i> (ibid., 36), <small>RINCA</small> <i>manige</i> (ibid., 729),
<i>he</i> <small>ÐAES WÆPNES</small> <i>onláh sélran sweord-frecan</i> = <i>he lent the
weapon to the brave hero</i> (ibid., 1468-69), <i>tó gebídanne</i>
<small>ÓÐRES YRFEWEARDES</small> = <i>to expect another heir</i> (ibid., 2453,)
<i>he ʒef Horse</i> <small>MÁDMES</small> <i>inoʒe</i> (L.I. 163, Fiedler and Sachs,
ii. p. 277).<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The genitive at the present day is confined
to certain characteristically special usages, and possesses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
several apparently independent significations. It must,
however, be noticed that the true inflectional genitive
in English is that which characterises the possessive
case; as, <i>John’s hat</i>. In other cases in Modern
English, we have commonly dropped the inflection, and
are accustomed to render the genitival relation by a
periphrasis with the preposition <i>of</i>. Using the word
<i>genitive</i> in this sense, we may say that the typical
usages of the genitive in modern English are the
possessive genitive (<i>the man’s brother</i>), the partitive
genitive (<i>a cup of wine</i>), and the genitive denoting
that the governing substantive is what it is in virtue of
what depends upon it (<i>the writer of the work</i>). This
last division falls naturally into two sub-divisions in
the case of nouns of action: the <i>subjective</i> genitive
(<i>surly Gloster’s governance</i>&mdash;Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI.,
I. iii.) and the <i>objective</i> genitive (<i>the government of
the country</i>). These usages have survived the various
original methods of the application of the genitive, and
they must thus be counted amongst genuine grammatical
categories.</p>

<p>The relation of the accusative to its governing verb
resembles the relation of the genitive to its governing
substantive. The most general definition of the meaning
of the accusative might be that it denotes any and
every kind of relation that a substantive can bear to a
verb, except that of a subject to its predicate. It is,
however, true that, in English, we are unable to employ
it in every case to denote such relation: nor, indeed,
does this use seem to have been permissible in the
original Indo-European languages; though it is true that
the accusative was used more freely and commonly in
old Greek and Latin, for instance, than in later times:
cf. such constructions as ἄπορα πόριμος (Æsch., Prom.
Vinctus); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid tibi hanc rem tactio est?</i> (Plautus, Pœnulus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
V. v. 29), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">humeros exsertus uterque</i> (Statius, Thebais,
v. 439). Hence, in considering the different uses
of the accusative, we must at the very outset place
those meanings side by side which have gradually
become independent.</p>

<p>The first distinction which we must remark in the
use of the accusative is that between the <i>free</i> accusative,
or accusative which is independent of the nature of the
verb which it follows,&mdash;as, <i>to buy a hat</i>,&mdash;and the <i>attached</i>
accusative, which is connected with a few verbs
only by a close tie, and in each case with a restricted
signification,&mdash;as, <i>to blow a gale</i>, <i>to row a race</i>. The
free accusative is more freely used in English than in
French or German; many of the relations which in
those languages are expressed by the genitive and
dative are in English expressed by the case under
consideration.</p>

<p>One of the original usages of the <i>free</i> accusative
was the expression of an extension <i>over space and time</i>;
and in this case, it is not always found with verbs. We
have in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæsar tridui iter processit</i> (Cæsar, Bell.
Gallic., i. 38); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguem non oportet discedere</i> (Cicero,
ad Att., xiii. 20): and, in English, such uses as <i>To
write of victories next year</i> (Butler, Hudibras, II., <small>III.</small>,
173); <i>My troublous dream this night</i> (Henry VI.,
Part II., Act. II., ii.); where the dative was usual in
Anglo-Saxon (see Koch, ii., p. 94; Mason, p. 147).
As instances of the <i>attached</i> accusative, we must
especially consider the accusative of such substantives
as are <small>ETYMOLOGICALLY CONNECTED</small> with the verb; as,
<i>to fight a hard fight</i>; <i>to see a strange sight</i>; <i>sangas
ic singe</i> (Ps. xxvi. 7).<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> This ‘cognate accusative’
most probably furnishes the cue to such constructions
as <i>Come and trip it as you go</i>, where <i>it</i> seems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
to replace some noun, as, e.g., <i>tripping</i>. Once established,
this use of <i>it</i> instead of a cognate noun in
the accusative, would easily be extended to cases like
<i>to foot it</i> for <i>to dance a dance</i>, where the use of the verb
<i>to foot</i> is but an ‘occasional’ one, and apparently too
unusual to admit of the formation of the noun <i>footing</i>
in the sense of <i>dance</i>. We must, then, suppose that the
word <i>it</i> stands for a <i>dance</i>, i.e. for an accusative not
cognate with the verb actually used, but with another
and synonymous verb. The use of the accusative of
towns in Latin, in answer to the question <i>Whither?</i>&mdash;as,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ire Romam</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tarentum</i>, etc., further illustrates the
<i>attached</i> accusative with which we may compare expressions
in English, as <i>to go west</i>; <i>flying south</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The usage, now common in English, whereby a
predicative adjective is connected with an intransitive
verb seems to be of later origin. Cf. <i>to cry one’s eyes
red</i>; <i>to wash one’s forehead cool</i>; <i>to eat one’s-self full</i>; <i>to
dance one’s-self tired</i>; <i>to shout one’s-self hoarse</i>. In these
cases the predicatival force of the accusative must be
regarded as a widening of the signification. No doubt,
however, special factors must have aided to bring this
construction into use: such as the survival of the
memory of the general signification of the accusative,
as representing the goal of the verbal action; and,
again, the analogy of such cases as <i>to shoot a man
dead</i>; <i>to buy a man free</i>; <i>to strike a man dumb</i>; <i>to beat
black and blue</i>;&mdash;where the accusative serves to define
the verb, and indeed, almost enters into composition
with it, as it in fact actually does in many cases in
German, like <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tot schlagen</i>; cf. the English <i>dumb-foundered</i>.
There are a large number of colloquial
phrases which are similar,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> such as <i>to talk a person’s
head off</i>; <i>to worm one’s-self into another’s confidence</i>; <i>to</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
<i>read one’s-self into an author</i>; <i>to laugh a man down</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>There is, next, the case of the accusative after <i>compound</i>
verbs, where the simple verbs are intransitive
or govern a different kind of accusative from that
taken by the verb when compounded. Such are
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circumdare</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præcellere</i> in Latin, and, in English, <i>to
forego</i>, <i>to underrate</i>, <i>to withstand</i>, <i>to outlast</i>; or, A.S.
<i>ofer-swimman</i>, <i>forestandan</i>, etc.; e.g., (hé) <i>oferswam
sioleða bigong</i>&mdash;<i>He swam across the sea</i> (Beowulf,
2368): <i>Wið ord and wið ecge ingang forstód</i>&mdash;<i>He
withstood entrance against sword and spear</i> (ibid.,
1550).<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> These are on the border line of ‘free’ and
‘attached’ accusatives.</p>

<p>There are certain verbs composed with certain
prefixes which, in virtue of their composition, receive
a transitive force; as, <i>belabour</i>, <i>begrudge</i>, <i>bewitch</i>, <i>belie</i>,
<i>befleck</i>, etc., and which, in some cases, receive in addition
the power of adopting a different kind of object,
generally calling in the aid of metaphor to extend
their meaning; as, <i>embody</i>, <i>encompass</i>, <i>enthral</i>, <i>overrule</i>.</p>

<p>An ‘attached’ accusative, or one properly attached
adverbially, in a defining and qualifying sense,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> to one
definite individual verb, has, as a rule, only one single
meaning, limited by use. But sometimes we find that
in this case, too, several applications have set in; such
may have been in some cases original, and in others
due to the fact that the one ‘usual’ signification has
extended by ‘occasional’ transgression. Take such
cases as <i>to blow a gale</i>, <i>to blow a sail</i>, <i>to strike a blow</i>; <i>to</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
<i>strike a man</i>, <i>to strike terror</i>; <i>to run a race</i>, <i>to run a
man down</i>; <i>to stone a man</i>, <i>to stone cherries</i>; <i>pacing the
ground</i>, <i>the morrice pacings</i>; <i>to keep a man from harm</i>,
<i>to keep harm from a man</i>; <i>to stick a man with a knife</i>,
<i>to stick a stamp</i>; and in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defendere aliquem ab
ardore solis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defendere ardorem solis ab aliquo</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prohibere
calamitatem a provincia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prohibere provinciam calamitate</i>;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutare equum mercede</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutare mercedem equo</i>.
So, too, in Greek: ἀρκεῖν τινα ἀπὸ κινδύνου; ἀρκεῖν
κίνδυνον ἀπό τινος.</p>

<p>Poetry has a strong tendency to aid such ‘occasional’
constructions to become ‘usual:’ for it is a
part of the technique of poetry to produce strong impressions
by using its material in a fresh and striking
way: thus we find in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vina cadis onerare</i> (Vergil,
Æneid, i. 199: a variation for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cados vinis</i>); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberare
obsidionem</i> (Livy, xxvi. 8), instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberare urbem
obsidione</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vina coronant</i> (Vergil, Æneid, iii. 526) instead
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pocula vinis coronant</i>: δάκρυα τέγγειν = ‘to stain
tears,’ instead of ‘to stain with tears’ (Pindar): αἷμα
δεύειν = ‘to stain blood,’ instead of ‘to stain with
blood’ (Sophocles). Thus, in English, we have <i>The
Attic warbler pours her throat</i> (Gray); <i>to languish a
drop of blood a day</i> (Shakespeare, Cymbeline, I. ii.) The
relation expressed by the accusative may in itself
be more than a single one; and thus the connection
of a single verb with several accusatives to express
different ideas is quite natural.</p>

<p>It seems hardly true to state that the Indo-European
prepositions governed any particular case. The
case which followed the preposition was actually referred
to the verb; the general meaning of the verb
was still felt and was merely specialised by the preposition;
whence it comes that the same preposition is
followed by different cases, each bearing its own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
special meaning. The Greek language offers good
examples of this, and seems to stand nearer the
original state, as far as usage goes. Take, for
instance, a preposition like πάρα. Its general meaning
may be defined as ‘from:’ when followed by the
genitive it signifies ‘proceeding from;’ when followed
by the accusative, ‘to,’ reference to the source not
being overlooked: similarly with κατά, μετά, etc.
In English, more than in most European languages,
the tendency has been to multiply the use of prepositions,
and to employ them independently of any feeling
for the case. The case has thus become more and more
independent of the preposition: the connection of the
latter with the case has become merely matter of custom;
and the consciousness of the original signification of
the case has become fainter. With regard to the Latin
prepositions which govern one case only (like <i>ex</i>, <i>ab</i>),
or which govern more than one without affecting the
sense (like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tenus</i>), the employment of the case is merely
traditional, and no value can be attached to it.
Between the absolute fixity of the one use and the
original freedom of the other use stands the employment
of <i>in</i>, <i>sub</i>, and <i>super</i>, sometimes with the ablative,
sometimes with the accusative, but with different
meanings for the respective cases.</p>

<p>The changes that have appeared in Syntax in the
case of prepositions are very well exemplified in
English, in which language their use has so greatly
spread, and plays such an important part. They were,
in the first place, prefixed to the verb, which they
qualified adverbially,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> forming, in fact, a compound
with it; as, ‘to <i>over</i>take,’ ‘<i>over</i>reach,’ ‘<i>over</i>look.’ They
were next detached from the verb, but not prefixed to
the noun; as, ‘to take <i>over</i>,’ ‘to reach <i>over</i>,’ ‘to look <i>over</i>;’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
and the difference in meaning between these three pairs
of phrases will show us how the preposition came to
lose memory of the proper signification of the case. In
a later stage still, they appear prefixed to nouns, and
serve to particularise the relations of actions to things&mdash;relations
which, in the inflected state of language, were
expressed by the case endings of nouns; cf. <i>Bigstandað
me strange genéatas</i> (Cædmon) = ‘Stout vassals bystand
me;’ <i>He heom stód wið</i> (Layamon) = ‘He them stood
against;’ or <i>Again the false paiens the Christens stode he
by</i> (P. Langtoft) = ‘Against the false pagans the Christians
he stood by;’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘He stood by the Christians.’</p>

<p>We sometimes find the partitive use of the genitive
replaced by apposition. The simplest and most
natural example of this is where the apposition is made
up of several members which are collectively the
equivalent of the substantive to which they are appended;
for instance, ‘They went, one to the right,
the other to the left;’ ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Postero die terrestrem navalemque
exercitum, non instructos modo, sed hos decurrentes,
classem in portu, simulacrum et ipsam edentem
navalis pugnæ ostendit</span>’ (Livy, xxix. 22). ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duæ
filiæ harum, altera occisa, altera capta est</span>’ (Cæsar,
Bell. Gallic., i. 53); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diversa cornua, dextrum ad
castra Sammitium, lævum ad urbem tendit</span>’ (Livy, x.
41); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capti ab Iugurtha, pars in crucem acti, pars
bestiis objecti sunt</span>’ (Sall., Iug.). But the same appositional
construction appears when the whole apposition
represents only a part of the expression or phrase of
which it is the expansion; as, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volsci maxima pars
cæsi,</span>’ (Livy): ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cetera multitudo decimus quisque ad
supplicium lecti</span>’ (Livy); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostri ceciderunt tres</span>’
(Cæsar); ‘My arrival, although an only son, unseen
for four years, was unable to discompose, etc.’ (Scott,
Rob Roy, i.); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tuum, hominis simplicis, pectus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
vidimus</span>’ (Cicero, Phil., ii. 43). This is also the case
where the subject is expressed only by the personal
termination of the verb; as, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plerique meminimus</span>’
(Livy); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simoni adesse me quis nuntiate</span>’ = ‘Tell
Simo, one or the other of you!’ (Plautus). Similarly, in
the case of the designation of materials, we find an
apposition taking the place of the partitive genitive;
thus we find, in Latin, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquid id genus</span>’ for ‘something
of that kind;’ ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scis me antea orationes aut aliquid
id genus solitum scribere</span>’ (Cicero, Att., xiii. 12); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pascuntur
omne genus objecto frumento maxime ordeo</span>’
(Varro, de Re Rustica, iii. 6);<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arma magnus numerus</span>’
(Livy). Thus, ‘He gained the sur-addition Leonatus’
(Shakespeare, Cymbeline, I. i.).</p>

<p>This more simple and primitive appositional construction
is very common in modern xml:lang; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein
stück brot</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein glas wasser</i>: in Middle High German
it was rarer; in modern Scotch it is common in such
instances as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">a wee bit body</i>, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">a curran days</i> (a number
of days): it was common in Anglo-Saxon; as, ‘scóp him
Heort naman’ (Beowulf, 78); <i>Emme broðer ðe queene</i>
(Robert of Gloucester); <i>The Duke of Burgoys,
Edmonde sonne</i> (Wa., i. 87); <i>David Kingdom</i> (R. of
G., i. 7.):<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and is found in Chaucer,&mdash;<i>Gif us a busshel
whet or malt or reye</i> (Canterbury Tales, 7328); <i>half
a quarter otes</i> (ibid., 7545): and has survived even
in modern English, in such cases as <i>The Tyrol passes</i>
(Coleridge, Picc., i. 10); <i>Through Solway sands,
through Tarras moss</i> (Scott, Lay of Last Minstrel,
i. 21). We must regard this method of apposition
as the most primitive in language; the two words in
apposition are simply placed side by side like two
Chinese roots, and must be looked upon as the simple
stems without any inflection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>Even the subject of a verb may deviate from
previous usage in the way whereby it denotes a relation:
cf. such phrases as <i>The cistern is running dry</i>; <i>The roof
drips with water</i>; <i>The trees drop honey</i>. Thus we can
say, <i>The river is running over</i>; <i>The wood is resonant
with song</i>; <i>The window will not shut</i>; <i>The fire will not
draw</i>; <i>The kettle boils</i>; <i>This sample tastes bad</i>; <i>The
hall thick swarming now with complicated monsters</i>
(Milton): in Italian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le vie correvano sangue</i> (Malespini):
in Spanish, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Corrieron sangue los rios</i>: <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sudare
mella</i> (Vergil, Ecl. iv., 30); cf. also, the use of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sapere</i>, in
Latin, in such cases as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum sapimus patruos</i> (Persius,
Sat. i., 11); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sentir</i>, in French, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela sent la guerre</i>.
In these cases we should expect the subject and object
to be inverted.</p>

<p>A similar departure from ordinary usage occurs in
the case of what we commonly speak of as ‘transferred’
epithets; <i>i.e.</i> adjectives referring to merely indirect
relations with the substantive to which they are
attached. Such are expressions like <i>wicked ways</i>;
<i>quiet hours</i>; <i>in ambitious Latin</i> (Carlyle, Past and
Present, ii. 2); <i>the blest abodes</i> (Pope, Essay on
Man, iii. 259). Many of these linguistic licences have
become quite usual, and it is forgotten that the epithet
attached to the word does not strictly fit it: thus we
speak quite commonly of <i>the happy event</i>, <i>a joyful
surprise</i>, <i>happy hours</i>, <i>a learned treatise</i>, <i>an intoxicated
condition</i>, <i>in a foolish manner</i>, <i>a gay supper</i>, <i>a bright
prospect</i>, etc.; and we can even say, <i>He gives us an
unhealthy impression</i>, <i>a stingy gift</i>, etc. The word
<i>secure</i> in English, like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sûr</i> in French, refers in the first
instance to a person who need not be anxious; in the
second place, to a thing or person about whom no one
need be anxious. Thus we can say, <i>I am safe in saying
that he is safe</i>. As soon as these freer combinations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
are apprehended as an ordinary epithet applied
to its substantive, we may state that a change in word-meaning
has occurred.</p>

<p>Such licence occurs in the case of the participles and
nouns in <i>-ing</i> even more than in that of adjectives; thus
we can say, <i>in a dismantled state</i> (Dickens, Pickwick,
2); <i>a smiling answer</i>; <i>this consummation of drunken
folly</i> (Scott, Rob Roy, 12); <i>a dazzling prospect</i>; <i>the
selling price</i>; <i>the dying day</i>; <i>a parting glass</i>; <i>writing
materials</i>; <i>sleeping compartment</i>; <i>dining room</i>; <i>singing
lesson</i>; <i>falling sickness</i>; <i>waking moments</i>; <i>the ravished
hours</i> (Parnell, Hesiod, 225). So, too, we speak of
<i>a talented man</i>; cf. also the common French expressions,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">thé dansant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café chantant</i>. Tacitus has such
uses as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Muciano volentia rescripsere</i> (Hist., iii. 52) for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volenti</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>We may probably compare with this use that of the
so-called ‘misrelated participle,’ a freely attached predicatival
attribute, which is indeed condemned as
ungrammatical and careless, but which still occurs very
commonly in even the best authors. Cf. ‘When <i>gone</i>
we all regarded each other for some minutes with
confusion’ (Goldsmith, Vicar of Wakefield, 13);

<span class="poem w50"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Thus <i>repulsed</i>, our final hope<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is flat despair’<br /></span>
<span class="author">(Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 142);<br /></span>
</span></span>

‘<i>Amazed</i> at the alteration in his manner, every
sentence that he uttered increased her embarrassment’
(Miss Austin, Pride and Prejudice, ch. xliii.).<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> We
are, indeed, accustomed to say that in this case we must
supply a subject, and that the full expression would
be ‘Amazed <i>as she was</i>,’ in the last instance cited. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
if we use such an expression as ‘a <i>pitying</i> tear,’ we
might maintain as well that it is necessary to explain
this as, ‘with a tear, shed in sign of his pity.’ The fact
is, that these loosely appended predicatival attributes
answer to a need felt in language, just as much as
such words as <i>regarding</i>, <i>during</i>, <i>vu que</i>, <i>instar</i>, supply
a requirement in the prepositional category.</p>

<p>In the case of participial constructions, the
participle expresses formally the time-relation in which
the condition or action denoted by the participle stands
to the finite verb. Thus, ‘<i>Being frightened</i> he runs
away’ expresses formally nothing more than the
temporal relation between the fright and what follows
it. It is, however, possible to understand different
relations as implied by this participle; thus there
would, in this instance, be a connection of cause and
effect. There are many cases in which, were we to
extend the participial construction into a separate
sentence, we should have to employ different conjunctions;
sometimes those denoting the reason,&mdash;as, ‘<i>Since</i>
he was frightened he ran away;’ sometimes we should
have to employ such conjunctions as denote an opposition,&mdash;as,
‘Notwithstanding that;’ thus, supposing
that the sentence in question ran, ‘Being frightened
he did <i>not</i> run away,’ this would naturally be broken
up into ‘<i>Notwithstanding</i> that he was frightened, he
did not run away.’ Sometimes, again, the participle
expresses a condition, as in such common cases as
‘<i>Failing</i> an heir, the property passes to the crown.’</p>

<p>Still it is unnecessary to assert that the participle, as
such, denotes these different meanings&mdash;such as cause,
condition, opposition, etc. These relations are only
accidental and <i>occasional</i>. When, however, we have
dependent sentences introduced <i>by a temporal conjunction</i>,
like <i>quum</i>, <i>since</i>, the accidental relation of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
conjunction to the governing sentence may come to
attach itself and become permanent; in this case, the
conjunction will experience a change of syntactical
meaning. Take the case of <i>since</i>, formed by the
adverbial genitive suffix <i>es</i>, from <i>sin</i> = <i>sithen</i> (from <i>sið</i>,
<i>þ̱am</i>, after that). <i>While</i>, again, from meaning ‘the time
that’ (a thing occurred,) has come to denote ‘in spite
of the fact that,’ in such phrases as ‘<i>While</i> you pretend
that you love me, you act as though you did not.’
In the case of the modern German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">weil</i>, the temporal
signification has completely disappeared; and in the
same way prepositions, such as <i>through</i> and <i>by</i>, which
possess strictly speaking a local or temporal meaning,
pass into a causal meaning.</p>

<p>The instances given above may serve to show the
way in which changes are constantly occurring in
syntax, and will aid in pointing out how language is
constantly aiming at supplying, in an economical
fashion, its needs as they successively present themselves.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="medium">CONTAMINATION.</span></h2>

<p>We have discussed, in Chapter V., the force of analogy
and its effect. We have now to study a phenomenon
of language which may be called ‘contamination,’ and
which, though widely differing from analogy in the
most characteristic instances of both, is yet so closely
allied to it as to render it a difficult matter to draw
any hard and fast line of demarcation between the two.</p>

<p>We call the process ‘contamination’ when two
synonymous forms or constructions force themselves
simultaneously, or at least in the very closest succession,
into our consciousness, so that one part of the
one replaces or, it may be, ousts a corresponding part
of the other; the result being that a new form arises
in which some elements of the one are confused with
some elements of the other.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, to take an imaginary case, a
person seeing a book on the table might wish to exclaim,
‘Take that thing away!’ Just, however, as he
is uttering the word <i>thing</i>, the consciousness that it is
properly called a <i>book</i> forces itself upon him, and he
utters the word <i>thook</i>. Of course such a form is a
mistake, and a mistake so palpable and, indeed, so
absurd that the speaker will at once correct it. Every
one, however, who is in the habit of watching closely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the utterances of others, and indeed of himself, will be
aware that such slips of the tongue are extremely
common; and it is clear that, though such formations
are, in the first instance, sudden and transitory, and
generally travel no further than the individual from
whom they proceed, yet they may, by repetition on
the part of the same individual, or, it may be, by
imitation, conscious or unconscious, on the part of
others, end by becoming ‘usual.’</p>

<p>Contamination manifests itself not merely in the
form of words, but also in their syntactical combination.
In the case of such a curious mixture of two
words as that which we took for our example, the
very grotesqueness of the result would probably bar
the way to the spreading of the word, though, as we
shall see, traces are to be found of cases hardly less
grotesque than this. In syntactical combinations,
however, the results have far more frequently proved
permanent; or, in any case, the results do not commonly
appear in such jarring contrast to received
usage as to challenge immediate correction, and, consequently,
instances can be more easily found in
literature of syntactical than of verbal contamination;
some cases of such contamination pass into language
and become ‘usual;’ some are refused admission into
normal language and are set down as the peculiarities
of the individual writer or speaker, or, it may be, as
his mistakes.</p>

<p>We saw that formation by analogy manifests itself
as the alteration of one form in compliance with a rule
more or less consciously abstracted from a number of
examples drawn from a group to which that form does
not, strictly speaking, belong. Contamination is the
alteration of one form on the model of another synonymous
form. The difficulty of distinguishing between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the two arises from this&mdash;that the contaminating
form or construction often derives additional force
from being associated with other members of its
group, so that it may be doubtful whether the rule
or the one synonym gave the impetus to the new
formation. Nevertheless, we may lay it down that
for analogy we must demand a sufficient number of
examples on which to base a rule; while for contamination,
a single form or construction may suffice. If
we bear in mind these main points of distinction, we
shall commonly find no difficulty in deciding to which
of the two classes we should refer any particular case.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Among the results of contamination in single
words, we must naturally expect that those have the
best chance of becoming permanent which least
deviate from the correct form; <i>i.e.</i> where the synonymous<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
forms confused resembled each other, and the
form due to their contamination consequently bore
sufficient resemblance to both to enable it to arise
repeatedly in the mouth of several speakers, and,
when formed, to escape observation. Thus the word
<i>milt</i> (the soft roe of fishes) is a substitute for <i>milk</i> (it
appears in Swedish as <i>mjölke</i>); this was probably due
to contamination with <i>milt</i> (spleen), which is a different
word.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Again, the English combination <i>ough</i> is due
to the contamination of three distinct forms, viz., <i>ugh</i>
(A.S. <i>-uh</i>), <i>-ogh</i> (A.S. <i>-áh</i>), <i>-oogh</i> (A.S. <i>-óh</i>); whilst, at
the same time, the loss of the <i>gh</i> has affected the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
quality of the preceding vowel by the principle of
compensation. Thus the word <i>through</i> should have
appeared as <i>thrugh</i>, A.S. *<i>ðruh</i> (for <i>ðurh</i>); but it has
been altered to <i>through</i>, as if from A.S. *<i>ðrúh</i>, or else
to *<i>thurgh</i> (A.S. <i>ðurh</i>), which has been lengthened to
<i>thor(ou)gh</i>.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>A.S. <i>byrðen</i>, ‘a load,’ became <i>burthen</i>, and is now
<i>burden</i>, the change being assisted by confusion with
<i>burden</i> (Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourdon</i>), ‘the refrain of a song.’<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The
word <i>anecdotage</i> is a wilful contamination of <i>anecdote</i> +
<i>dotage</i>, with a side glance at <i>age</i> (time of life), though
in <i>dotage</i> the suffix <i>age</i> has no connection with the
noun of same sound. <i>Another-gaines</i>, which was used
by Sydney in his Arcadia (1580) seems to have
resulted from the confusion of <i>anotherkins</i> (of another
kind), which survives in the Whitby dialect, and
<i>anothergates</i> (of another gate, manner). On these
instances, see Murray’s Dictionary, s.v.</p>

<p>In this and similar instances, where the fact that
the word occurs in more than one meaning is due to
confusion or misconception, it is often difficult to say
whether we have to deal with contamination proper,
as we defined it and illustrated it by the example on
page 140. There exist, however, in many languages
words and forms which can be explained in no other
way. Such is the O.Fr. form <i>oreste</i>, a contamination
between <i>orage</i> and <i>tempeste</i>; and again, the O.Fr.
<i>triers</i> seems to be a contamination between <i>tres</i> (trans)
and <i>rier</i> (retro).<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>The confusion was rendered easier in the case of
forms which may easily pass into a grammatical paradigm.
Thus, from the Italian <i>o</i> of <i>sono</i> and the perfect
termination in <i>-ro</i> (= <i>runt</i>), the <i>o</i> was transferred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
to the other third person plural forms; whence such
forms as old Tuscan <i>fecérono</i> (modern <i>furono</i>) are contaminations
between the forms <i>fecéro</i> and <i>amano</i>.</p>

<p>The confusion of words belonging to the same
etymological group is more common: an instance may
be seen in the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trápano</i> (τρύπανον), whose form
seems to have been affected by <i>traforare</i>.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> In Old
French the form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doins</i> is due to a contamination between
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dois</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don</i>. In Provençal, the form <i>sisclar</i>
seems a contamination between <i>sibilare</i> and <i>fistulare</i>.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
The English <i>yawn</i> represents a fusion of two Anglo-Saxon
forms, <i>géonian</i> and <i>gánian</i>.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The word <i>minnow</i>
is a contamination between M.E. <i>menow</i> and the O.Fr.
<i>menuise</i>. Both of these are ultimately from the same
base, <i>min</i> (small),<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> but underwent a different development.
We might add as an instance the jocular coinage
<i>squarson</i> = Squire + Parson.</p>

<p>Our word <i>ache</i> offers a further curious illustration.
There was in Anglo-Saxon a verb <i>ácan</i> with past
tense <i>oc</i>, past participle <i>acen</i>, which gave us the verb
<i>ake</i> (to hurt)&mdash;now erroneously spelt <i>ache</i>, but still correctly
pronounced. The noun in Anglo-Saxon was
<i>æce</i>, in which the <i>k</i> sound was palatalised into the
sound of <i>ch</i> (in church), whilst it remained <i>k</i> in
the verb.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Accordingly we find still in Shakespeare
the distinction between the verb <i>ake</i> and the noun
<i>ache</i> (pronounced with <i>tch</i> as in <i>batch</i>, etc.). The confusion
began about <small>A.D.</small> 1700, when the verb began to
replace the noun in pronunciation, and occasionally
the spelling <i>ache</i> was used for both noun and verb.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
The prevalence of this spelling at present is mainly
due, it appears, to a mistaken derivation from the
Gr. ἄχος;&mdash;the pronunciation to confusion, or to contamination
of the noun by the verb.</p>

<p>We reach the borderland of ‘Analogy,’ if we do
not actually enter it, in those cases where a word&mdash;under
the influence of a modal group with a synonymous
function&mdash;assumes a suffix or prefix whose modal
significance was already expressed by the word in its
simpler form. Thus it has been considered a case of
contamination of the comparative <i>worse</i> with the modal
groups of the other comparatives in <i>er</i>, when we find
the double comparative <i>worser</i>. Similarly, the Latin
frequentative <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iactare</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iacio</i>) was extended into <i>iactitare</i>
under the influence of the modal group composed of
words like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">volitare</i>, etc.: again, in English, the form
<i>lesser</i> has, as an adjective, almost entirely superseded
the form <i>less</i>; just as, in the colloquial language of the
uneducated, we find <i>leastest</i> by the side of <i>least</i>. There
is, in Gothic, a superlative <i>aftuma</i>, beside which we,
however, find even there the double superlative <i>aftumists</i>.
This appears in Anglo-Saxon<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> as <i>æftermest</i>,
M.E. <i>eftermeste</i>, and in Modern English as <i>aftermost</i>;
where the <i>o</i> in the last syllable is due to the mistaken
idea that the whole word was a compound of <i>most</i>,
though, as we have seen, it was really another instance
of a double suffix.</p>

<p>Contamination plays a far more important part in
the area of syntax. It is easy to cull from the pages
of authors of repute instances of anomalies which have
no permanent influence on language: cf. ‘Amazed at
the alteration in his manner, every sentence that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
uttered increased her embarrassment’ (Miss Austen,
Pride and Prejudice, ch. 43,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>&mdash;a confusion between
‘She was amazed at the alteration,’ etc., and ‘Amazed
as she was.’) There are many similar constructions
in Shakespeare: cf. ‘Marry, that I think be young
Petruchio’ (a confusion of ‘That I think <i>is</i>’ and ‘I
think that <i>be</i>’&mdash;Romeo and Juliet, I. v. 133); so,
again, ‘Why do I trifle thus with his despair is done
to cure it’ (a confusion between ‘<i>Why</i> I trifle is <i>to cure</i>’
and ‘My trifling is done to cure,’&mdash;Lear, IV. vi. 33).<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
The following are instances of syntactical contamination
from various quarters:&mdash;‘Showering him with
abuse and blows’ (Mary L. Booth, Translation of
‘Abdallah’ by Laboulaye, p. 4,&mdash;from ‘Showering
abuse and blows upon him’ and ‘Overwhelming him
with abuse and blows’).

than to Paris’).<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>In many cases the contamination has become usual.
We say in English, <i>I am friends with him</i>, from ‘I
am friendly with him’ and ‘We are friends.’ The
Danish popular idiom is similar: <i>Han er gode venner
med dem</i> (He is good friends with them). Compare
too, the following expressions: ‘a friend <i>of mine</i>;’ <i>Fare
thee well</i> (a confusion between ‘Keep thee well’ and
‘Fare well’). <i>On my behalf</i> arose out of a confusion
of the A.S. <i>on healfe</i>, ‘on the side of,’ with a second
common phrase <i>be healfe</i>, ‘by the side of.’<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In Greek
we find expressions like ὁ ἥμισυς τοῦ χρόνου, a confusion
between ὁ ἥμισυς χρόνος and τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ χρόνου, etc.;
in Spanish, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchas de virgines</i>, instead of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchas virgines</i>
or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mucho de virgines</i>: in Italian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la più delle gente</i>
(Boccaccio). We have a similar instance of contamination
in the case of the Latin gerund: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pœnarum solvendi
tempus</i> (Lucretius), from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pœnarum solvendarum</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pœnas solvendi; nominandi istorum quam edundi erit
copia</i> (Plautus, Captivi, IV. ii. 72). Cicero, again,
writes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eorum partim in pompa partim in acie illustres
esse voluerunt</i>, in which there is a confusion between
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eorum pars</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ii partim</i>. Occasionally, a contamination
results from the confusion of the active and passive
constructions; e.g., <i>I care na by how few may see</i>
(Burns’s song, ‘First when Maggie was my care’).</p>

<p>Sometimes an inaccuracy arises owing to the idea
of a word which might have been used displacing the
word which actually was used by the writer. Thus,
for instance, the idea of the inhabitants displaces that
of the town or the country: cf. Θεμιστοκλῆς φεύγει ἐς
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Κέρκυραν, ὢν αὐτὼν εὐεργέτης (Thuc., 1. 136): <i>Auditæ
legationes quorum</i> (Tacitus, Annals, iii. 63). Cf. <i>The
revolt of the Netherlands</i> (for <i>the Netherlanders</i>) <i>from
Spain</i>; ‘That faction (for <i>the partisans</i>) in England
<i>who</i> most powerfully opposed his pretensions’ (Mrs.
Macaulay.)<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Here belongs the pleonastic use of
pronouns, common in English: cf. ‘I bemoan Lord
Carlisle, <i>for whom</i>, although I have never seen him,
and he may never have heard of me, I have a sort
of personal liking <i>for him</i>’ (Miss Mitford, Letters
and Life, 2nd Series, 1872, vol. ii., p. 160).<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> In
Latin and Greek we often find the relative referring
to a possessive pronoun, as if the personal pronoun
had preceded: cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudare fortunas meas qui natum
haberem</i> (Terence, And., I. i. 69);<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Τῆς ἐμῆς ἐπεισόδου,
ὃν μήτ’ ὀκνεῖτε (‘The approach of me whom neither
fear ye’&mdash;Sophocles, Œd. Col., 730).</p>

<p>We have next to note confusions of the comparative
and superlative manner of expression, resulting in combinations
like ‘Hi ceterorum Britannorum <i>fugacissimi</i>’
(Tacitus, Agricola). Cf. ‘The climate of Pau is perhaps
the <i>most genial</i> and the <i>best suited</i> to invalids of any
other spot in France’ (Murray, Summer in Pyrenees,
vol. i., p. 131). ‘Mr. Stanley was the only one <i>of his
predecessors</i> who slaughtered the natives of the region
he passed through’ (<i>London Examiner</i>, Feb. 16,
1878, p. 204).<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>A case of contamination sometimes results from the
idea of the past time rising into memory simultaneously
with that of present time: cf., in Latin, the
use of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iamdudum</i> when joined to the imperative; as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iamdudum sumite pœnas</i> (Vergil, Æneid, ii. 103),&mdash;a
confusion between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iam sumite pœnas</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sumite pœnas
iamdudum meritas</i>, i.e. between the thoughts ‘pray
take’ and ‘you should long ago have taken.’ Cf. <i>Those
dispositions that of late transform you from what you
rightly are</i> (Lear, I. iv. 242), and <i>He is ready to cry
all the day</i>; cf., also, such instances in Latin as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Idem
Atlas generat</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cratera antiquum quem dat Sidonia
Dido</i> (Vergil, Æneid, ix. 266), where the <i>effect</i> of the
action once performed is intended to be brought out by
the use of the present.</p>

<p>We often find in English an interrogation with the
infinitive, where we should expect a finite verb; as,
<i>I do not know what to do</i>; where we should rather
have expected <i>I do not know what I should do</i>. This
construction seems a confusion between cases in which
the infinitive was directly dependent on the verb
without any interrogative, as, <i>Scit dicere</i> (He can say);
<i>Il sait dire</i>: and such constructions as <i>What to say?
I do not know</i>. Other instances are <i>Shelley, like Byron,
knew early what it was to love</i> (Medwin’s Memoirs of
Byron, p. 9); <i>How have I then with whom to hold
converse</i> (Milton); <i>then sought where to lie hid</i> (ibid.);
<i>hath not where to lay his head</i>. This construction is
common in the Romance languages; as in French,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je
ne sais quel parti prendre</i>; Italian,&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">non ho che dire</i>;
Spanish,&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">non tengo con quien hablar</i>; Latin,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatus
ecquid haberet super ea re dicere</i> (Aul. Gellius, iii. 1).</p>

<p>Another form of syntactical contamination is when
an interrogative sentence is made dependent on a
verb, and, at the same time, the subject of this interrogative
sentence is made the verb’s nominal object;
as, <i>I know thee who thou art: You hear the learned Bellario
what he writes</i> (Merchant of Venice, IV. i. 167):
cf., also, Lear, I. i. 272. This usage is common in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Latin; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nosti Marcellum quam tardus sit</i> (Cicero):
in Italian an instance occurs in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tu’l saprai bene chi è</i>
(Boccaccio).</p>

<p>Similarly, we have cases in which the subject of an
objective clause introduced by <i>that</i> becomes a nominal
object of the principal verb; as, <i>All saw him, that he was
among the prophets</i>: so, too, the <i>object</i> of some subordinate
clause may be also object of the main verb;
e.g., <i>They demanded £400, which she knew not how to
pay</i>.</p>

<p>We find in English such phrases as ‘<span class="smcap">Such</span> of the
Moriscoes might remain <small>WHO</small> demeaned themselves as
Christians’ (Watson’s Life of Philip III.)<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> We find
in common use such phrases as <i>such as I saw</i> side
by side with <i>the same which I saw</i>, or <i>that I saw</i>.
Bacon writes <i>such which must go before</i>; and Shakespeare,
<i>Thou speakest to</i> <small>SUCH</small> <i>a man</i> <small>THAT</small> <i>is no
fleering tell-tale</i> (Julius Cæsar, I. iii). So Fuller: <i>Oft-times</i>
<small>SUCH WHO</small> <i>are built four stories high are observed
to have little in their cockloft</i>. In Latin, we similarly
find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">idem</i> followed by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut</i>, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eadem sunt iniustitia
ut si in suam rem aliena convertant</i>. In English, again,
we find sentences <span class="nowrap">like&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘But scarce were they hidden away, I declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than</i> the giant came in with a curious air’<br /></span>
<span class="author">(Tom Hood, Junr., Fairy Realm, p. 87);<br /></span>
</span></span>

<i>It is said that nothing was so teasing to Lord Erskine</i>
<small>THAN</small> <i>being constantly addressed by his second title of
Baron Clackmannan</i> (Sir H. Bulwer, Historical Characters,
vol. ii., p. 186, Cobbett). We say ‘each time
<i>when</i>’ and ‘each time <i>that</i>’ (similarly, in French we
find ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au temps <i>où</i></span>,’ and, at an earlier period, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
temps <i>que</i></span>’); ‘the rather <i>because</i>,’ as well as ‘the
rather <i>that</i>.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>In English we frequently find constructions like
‘Mac Ian, <i>while</i> putting on his clothes, was shot
through the head’ (Macaulay, History of England,
vii., p. 24); ‘I wrote an epitaph for my wife <i>though</i>
still living’ (Goldsmith, Vicar of Wakefield, ii.). In
these cases, the predicatival attribute has the same
function as a dependent sentence introduced by a conjunction;
and consequently the circumstance described
is rendered more exact by the placing of certain conjunctions
before the simple adjective. So, in French,
we say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je le fis quoique obligé</i>; and, in Italian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">benchè
costretto</i>. Similarly, in Latin, many conjunctions are
placed before the ablative absolute; cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamvis iniqua
pace, honeste tamen viverent</i> (Cicero): <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etsi aliquo accepto
detrimento</i> (Cæsar).</p>

<p>Conversely, the fact that dependent sentences and
prepositional determinants may have the same function,
causes prepositions to be used to introduce dependent
sentences. This use is especially common in English:
cf. <span class="smcap">Except</span> <i>a man be born</i> (St. John iii. 5); <span class="smcap">For</span> <i>I cannot
flatter thee in pride</i> (Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI., I.
iii); <span class="smcap">After</span> <i>he had begotten Seth</i> (Genesis); sometimes
this usage extends to cases where the strict written
language hesitates to accept it as usual; as, ‘<i>without</i>
they were ordered’ (Marryat); ‘I hate him <i>for</i> he is
a Christian, but more for that&mdash;he lends’ (Merchant of
Venice, I. iii. 43). <i>Till</i> and <i>until</i> are specially common
in this use. Indeed, the prepositional use of these
words has almost died out in Modern English, but
is frequent in the literature of the Elizabethan age;
cf. Shakespeare, ‘From the first corse <i>till</i> he that
died to-day’ (Hamlet, I. ii. 105), where <i>he</i> should,
strictly speaking, be <i>him</i>. Other instances are quoted
by Abbott, § 184. It must, however, be particularly
noticed that the constructions <i>for that</i>, <i>after that</i>, etc.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
may be used instead of <i>for</i>, <i>after</i>, when these words
are used as conjunctions. A preposition also stands
before indirect questions: cf. ‘<i>at</i> the idea of how sorry
she would be’ (Marryat): ‘the daily quarrels <i>about</i>
who shall squander most’ (Gay).</p>

<p>The result of contamination in syntax is often a
pleonasm. Thus, in Latin, we frequently meet with
several particles expressive of similarity; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pariter
hoc fit atque ut alia facta sunt</i> (Plautus): and, again, we
find expressions like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi si</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi si</i>.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Thus, in English,
we meet with the common but incorrect expression
<i>like as if</i>. We can connect a preposition either with
a substantive or with a governing verb: we can say,
<i>the place I am in</i>, or, <i>the place in which I am</i>. The
two even occur in combination: cf. <i>That fair</i> <small>FOR</small>
<i>which love groaned</i> <small>FOR</small> (Shakespeare, Romeo and
Juliet, I. v., chorus), and, <i>In what enormity is Marcus
poor in...?</i> (Coriolanus, II. i. 18). Nay, we often
find such expressions as <i>of our general’s</i> (Shakespeare,
Antony and Cleopatra, I. i. 1), instead of <i>of our general</i>
or <i>our general’s</i>; ‘If one may give that epithet to
any opinion <i>of a father’s</i>’ (Scott, Rob Roy, ch. ii.);
‘He is likewise a rival <i>of mine</i>, that is my other <i>self’s</i>’
(Sheridan): cf. also the common pleonasm <i>of ours</i>.
Sometimes, to adverbs of place&mdash;themselves denoting
the direction whence&mdash;is added a preposition
with a similar meaning; as, <i>from henceforth</i> (Luke
v. 10): cf. ‘I went <i>from thence</i> on to Edinburgh’ (Life
of George Grote, ch. ii., p. 187).</p>

<p>Other instances of pleonasms arising from syntactical
contamination are: ‘He saw that <i>the reason why</i>
witchcraft was ridiculed was <i>because</i> it was a phase of
the miraculous, etc.’ (Lecky, History of Rationalism,
vol. i., p. 126); ‘<i>The reason why</i> Socrates was condemned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
to death was <i>on account of</i> his unpopularity’
<i>Times</i>, February 27, 1871).<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Double comparatives and superlatives pleonastically
resulting from syntactical contamination are not
unusual in English: cf. ‘Farmers find it far <i>more
profitable</i> to sell their milk wholesale <i>rather than</i> to
retail it’ (Fawcett, Pauperism, ch. vi., p. 237): ‘Still
it was on the whole <i>more satisfactory</i> to his feeling to
take the directest means of seeing Dorothea <i>rather
than</i> to use any device,’ etc. (Middlemarch, vol. iii.,
bk. vi., ch. lxii., p. 365). Thus we have in Shakespeare,
<i>more kinder</i>, <i>more corrupter</i>, and <i>most unkindest</i> (Julius
Cæsar, III. ii. 187); and <i>thy most worst</i> (Winter’s
Tale, III. ii. 180). In poetry, again, we find adjectives
with a superlative sense compared; as, <i>perfectest</i>,
<i>chiefest</i> (Shakespeare), <i>extremest</i> (Milton), <i>more perfect</i>
(English Bible), <i>lonelier</i> (Longfellow).<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>In Latin and Greek, we find the comparative where
we should expect the positive; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante alios immanior
omnes</i> (Vergil, Æneid, iv.); αἱρετώτερον εἶναι τὸν καλὸν
θάνατον ἀντὶ τοῦ αἰσχροῦ βίου (Xenophon). In Scotch it
is usual to say <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">He is quite better again</i> for <i>He is quite
well again</i>. We find the positive where we should
expect the comparative, as in St. Mark ix. 43; Καλόν
σοι ἐστί ... ἤ (It is good for thee than, etc.). We
also find the superlative used where the comparative
would be regular: cf. Theocritus, xv. 139: Ἕκτωρ,
Ἑκάβας ὁ γεραίτατος εἴκατι παίδων.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Pleonasm arising from contamination occurs most
extensively in the case of <i>negations</i>. Cf. ‘There was
no character created by him into which life and reality
were <i>not</i> thrown with such vividness that the thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
written did <i>not</i> seem to his readers the thing actually
done’ (Forster’s Life of Dickens, vol. ii., ch. ix., p.
181). In older stages of English, as of German and
French, this usage was very common. Cf. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parceque la
langue française cort parmi le monde est la plus délitable
à lire et à oir que nulle autre</i> (Martin da Canale);<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wird
das hindern können, dass man sie nicht schlachtet?</i>
(Schiller). In Chaucer and Shakespeare the use of
the double negative is common: <i>First he denied you
had in him no right</i> (Comedy of Errors, IV. ii. 7).
<i>You may deny that you were not the cause</i> (Richard III.,
I. iii. 90).<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> With this we may compare the redundant
negative in Greek after verbs of denying: οὐκ ἀπαρνοῦμαι
τὸ μή; and, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non dubito quin</i>: cf. also the use
of the double negative in Plautus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neque illud haud
objiciet mihi</i> (Epid., V. i. 5). In these cases a negative
appears with an infinitive where the main verb
itself contains a quasi-negatival force: numerous
instances may be found in Shakespeare; cf. <i>Forbade
the boy he should not pass those grounds</i> (Pas. Pilgrim,
9).</p>

<p>So we find a contamination of the two constructions:
‘not&mdash;and not’ and ‘neither&mdash;not’ in cases like
Shakespeare’s ‘Be not proud, nor brag not of thy
might’ (Venus and Adonis, 113), = Be not ... and
brag not + neither be ... nor brag.</p>

<p>Compare also, ‘I cannot choose one nor refuse
none’ = I cannot choose one and I can (or may)
refuse none + I can neither choose one nor refuse
one.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>A pleonastic negation occurs in French and
other languages after words signifying ‘without:’ cf.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Mätzner, Fr. Gr., § 165: <i>Sans</i> <small>NUL</small> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">égard pour nos
scrupules</i> (Béranger); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle ne voyait aucun être souffrant
sans que son visage <small>N</small>’exprimât la peine qu’elle en
ressentait</i> (Bernardin de St. Pierre).<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> A curious pleonasm
of the article occurs in the following sentence:
<i>No stronger and stranger</i> <small>A</small> <i>figure is described in the
modern history of England</i> (Justin McCarthy, History
of our own Times, vol. i., ch. ii., p. 31); a contamination
between <i>There was not a stronger figure</i>, and
<i>No stronger figure</i>.</p>

<span class="medium">ORIGINAL CREATION.</span></h2>

<p>We must not suppose that the conditions under which
language was originally created were different from
those which we are able to trace and to watch in the
process of its historical development. We must not
suppose that mankind once possessed a special faculty
for coining language, and that this faculty has died out.
Education and experience must have developed our
faculties no less for the creation of language than for
other purposes; and if we have ceased to create new
materials for language at the present day, the reason
must be that we have no further need to do so. The
mass of linguistic material which we have inherited is,
in fact, so great that it is scarcely possible for us to
conceive a new idea for which, in the existing language,
we could not find some word or form either ready to
our hand, or capable of being made more or less suitable
to express it, or at least able to supply some
derivative for the purpose. On the other hand, we
must admit that the process of new creation has never
wholly ceased in language; and even in English we
find a certain quantity of words whose derivation is
unknown, and which seem to be unconnected with any
Indo-European language; <i>e.g.</i>, dog, rabbit, ramble, etc.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>Again, we must not suppose that the history of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
language falls into two parts&mdash;a period of <i>roots</i>, and
another period when language was <i>built up</i> of roots.
At first, indeed, every idea to be expressed demanded
the creation of a new term; and even when
the stock of existing words had already become considerable,
new thoughts must constantly have arisen
for which, as yet, there was no expression. Still, as the
existing vocabulary grew larger, the necessity for absolutely
new words, not connected with or derived from
others already existing, grew less and less; and it
would therefore seem as if the need for such formations
would have gradually disappeared completely. But
a little consideration will suffice to show that, at all
stages in the history of language, there must have
existed a certain necessity for new creations to express
new ideas; and we have a right to assume that in later
times, as civilisation grew more complex, the degree
in which new creations were necessary remained a considerable
one.</p>

<p>The essence of original creation consists in the fact
that a group of sounds is connected with a group of
ideas, without the intervening link of any association
already existing between a similar, related sound-group,
and a similar, related idea. When the Dutch
chemist, Van Helmont, conceived the novel idea of a
category which should embrace all such substances as
<i>air</i>, <i>oxygen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>, etc., he invented a new term,
‘gas,’ which, unless the fancied connection with the
word ‘geest’ (ghost) was indeed present in his mind,
was a ‘new creation.’ If, on the other hand, some one
were now to invent some entirely new process of treating
gases, or of treating other substances with gases,
and to indicate such an operation by some such form
as <i>gasel</i>, the word <i>gasel</i> would no doubt be quite new,
but we should not speak of it as an ‘original creation’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
in the sense in which we use the words in this chapter.
It would be a new <i>derivative</i>.</p>

<p>Original creation is due, in the first instance, to an
impulse which may disappear and leave no permanent
traces. It is necessary, in order that a real language
may arise from this process, that the sounds should
have operated upon the mind so that memory can
reproduce them. It is further necessary that other
individuals should understand the sounds which thus
constitute a word, and should be able to reproduce
them as well.</p>

<p>We find that the new is named in language after
what is already known; in fact, the old and the new
stand related to each other as cause and effect: in
other words, the new is not produced without some
kind of connection with the old. This connection
generally consists of some pre-existing association
between cognate words and cognate ideas. In the
case, then, of original creation, the essence of which
we declared to be the absence of that link, some other
connection must exist; and this will generally be found
in the fact that the sounds and their signification suggest
each other. The sounds in that case will strike
the generality of hearers as appropriate to the meaning
intended to be conveyed, and the speaker will be conscious
that those sounds are peculiarly fitted to express
the idea which is in his mind. As an instance, we
might take the barbarously constructed word ‘electrocution,’
now in use in America to denote the new
method of inflicting the death penalty in that country.
The word <i>electric</i> is understood; and so is the word
<i>execution</i>: the barbarous new word is the effect of our
previous comprehension of these two words. Such
appropriateness will secure the repetition of the new
creation by the same speaker, and make probable the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
spontaneous creation of the same term by various
speakers living in the same mental and material
surroundings, both which effects are essential conditions
for the common acceptance of the new expression.</p>

<p>The most obvious class of words to illustrate this
connection between sound and meaning is what is
known as ‘onomatopoietic;’ <i>i.e.</i> names which were
plainly coined in order to imitate sounds. The most
common of these are such as seem to be imitations
of noises and movements. Such are <i>click</i>, <i>clack</i>, <i>clink</i>,
<i>clang</i>, <i>creak</i>, <i>crack</i>, <i>ding</i>, <i>twang</i>, <i>rattle</i>, <i>rustle</i>, <i>whistle</i>,
<i>jingle</i>, <i>croak</i>, <i>crash</i>, <i>gnash</i>, <i>clatter</i>, <i>chatter</i>, <i>twitter</i>, <i>fizz</i>,
<i>whiz</i>, <i>whisk</i>, <i>whiff</i>, <i>puff</i>, <i>rap</i>, <i>slap</i>, <i>snap</i>, <i>clash</i>, <i>dash</i>, <i>hum</i>,
<i>buzz</i>, <i>chirp</i>, <i>cheep</i>, <i>hiss</i>, <i>quack</i>, <i>hoot</i>, <i>whirr</i>, <i>snarl</i>, <i>low</i>,
<i>squeak</i>, <i>roar</i>, <i>titter</i>, <i>snigger</i>, <i>giggle</i>, <i>chuckle</i>, <i>whimper</i>,
<i>croon</i>, <i>babble</i>, <i>growl</i>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Those with the suffix <i>le</i> are used
to express iteration, and so to form frequentative verbs.
These suffixes are specially noticeable in words of
imitative origin, such as the list given in Skeat,
English Etymology, p. 278. Some verbs denote
at once a noise and an explosion, like <i>bang</i>, <i>puff</i>;
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pan</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouf</i>: others a noise and motion, as <i>fizz</i>,
<i>whirr</i>. These are words which appear to date from
comparatively modern English. There would be no
difficulty in gathering from Greek and Latin parallel
instances, namely of words imitative of sounds, which
seem to be new creations and have no apparent connection
with any other Indo-European language, such
as <i>gannire</i>, χρεμετίζειν.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that, as far as we can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
judge, the original creations of language must have
consisted in words expressive of emotion on the one
hand, and of sounds on the other.</p>

<p>Because, in such words as we have been considering,
we recognise an intimate affinity between the
sound and the signification, it does not however follow
that all these words must necessarily have been in
their origin onomatopoietic. There are some cases in
which the words have been consciously modified so as
to imitate the sound; as, <i>hurtle</i>, <i>mash</i>, <i>smash</i>. <i>Some</i>
may thus, perhaps, only <i>seem</i> to be ‘new creations,’ but
it is very unlikely that this is generally the case. Nay,
we may say it is certain that most of such words as we
have been considering are ‘new creations,’ and we are
further strengthened in this conviction by the fact that
we frequently find words of similar meaning, and very
similar forms, which cannot, according to the laws of
sound, be referred to a single original; such are, e.g.,
<i>crumple</i>, <i>rumple</i>, <i>crimp</i>; <i>slop</i>, <i>slap</i>, <i>slip</i>; <i>squash</i>, <i>gash</i>;
<i>grumble</i>, <i>rumble</i>. These seem to support the idea that
they were formed as imitative of sound.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, however, the only absolutely
certain original creations are interjections. True interjections,
at least those usually employed, are as
truly learnt by tradition as any other elements of
language, and it is owing to their association that they
come to express emotion. But, as reflex-utterances to
sudden emotions, they essentially belong to the class
of words we are now considering. Once existing, they
become conventional, and hence it is that we see
different sounds employed to express the same emotions
in different languages. Thus we have in English
to express surprise, <i>Dear me!</i>&mdash;in Greek, Παπαί&mdash;German,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aha!</i> The Englishman says <i>Hulló</i> with
rising, where the Portuguese would say <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Holà</i>, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
falling intonation. To express pain, we have <i>Alas!</i>
<i>Welladay!</i> <i>Woe’s me!</i>&mdash;in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach! Weh! Au!</i>&mdash;in
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh! Hélas! Ciel!</i>&mdash;in Gaelic, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Och! Och
mo chreach!</i> To express joy, we have in English,
<i>Hurrah</i>, <i>Good!</i>&mdash;in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heida! Heisa! Juch!
Juchheisa!</i>&mdash;in Greek, Εὖγε!&mdash;in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Evax!</i>&mdash;in
French, the old expression, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh gay!</i> (Molière, Mis.,
Act. I., sc. iii.). Hence it is, too, that individuals
employing the same dialect employ different interjections
to express the same emotion. Thus, different
individuals in the same linguistic community might
employ, to express disgust or disbelief, <i>Pshaw!</i> <i>Fudge!</i>
<i>Stuff!</i> <i>Nonsense!</i> etc.</p>

<p>Of the interjections cited above, it may be noticed
that some, like <i>Pshaw!</i> and <i>Pooh!</i> seem to be a
primitive and simple expression of feeling. Most
interjections, however, seem to be made up of existing
words or groups of words; cf. <i>farewell</i>, <i>welcome</i>, <i>hail</i>,
<i>good</i>, <i>welladay</i>, <i>bother</i>, <i>by ‘r Lady</i>, <i>bosh</i>: and this is the
case in the most various languages. In many cases,
their origin is quite concealed by sound changes; as in
<i>hélas</i>, which is really derived from the natural sound
<i>hé</i>, and <i>las</i>, ‘weary,’ and has come to be pronounced
‘hél<i>as</i>.’ Other instances are <i>Welladay!</i> <i>Zounds!</i> (i.e.
<i>God’s wounds</i>), <i>Jiminy</i> (i.e. <i>Jesu Domine</i>). Some of
these have been assimilated by popular etymology to
words existing in the language; such as <i>Welladay!</i>
into which meaningless expression the old form
wellaway (A.S. <i>wá lá wá</i> = <i>wo! lo! wo!</i>) has been
turned. Other instances are <i>harrow</i>, in Chaucer, from
N.F. <i>haro</i>; <i>goodbye</i>, from <i>God be wi’ ye</i>; <i>palsangguné</i> =
<i>par le sang béni</i> (Molière); <i>cadedis</i>, in Gascon, (= <i>cap
de Dieu</i> = caput Dei). Some, again, have come to be
used as expressions of emotion, being in their origin
foreign words whose signification is partially or wholly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
forgotten; such are <i>Hosannah!</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> (Save, we pray),
<i>Hallelujah!</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> (Praise ye Jehovah).</p>

<p>There seems, however, to be a certain number of
words which owed their origin immediately to reflex
movements, and which come to be employed when we
happen to again experience a similar sudden excitement.
Such words as these are <i>bang</i>, <i>dash</i>, <i>hurrah</i>,
<i>slap</i>, <i>crack</i>, <i>fizz</i>, <i>boom</i>. There are, probably, ‘interjections’
which, in single cases, are natural productions,
and in all cases lie near the field of natural production;
<i>e.g.</i>, the sign of shuddering, or shivering with cold,
horror, fright (often written <i>ugh!</i>). It accompanies the
shiver of the body and is itself the result of an expulsion
of air from the lungs through the vocal passages
where all the muscles are in a state of sympathetic
contraction. <i>Aau!</i> may also be, in single cases, a
natural production. <i>Aautch</i> is a sort of diminutive
of it. Again, the sound used in clearing the throat is
a purely natural production. Coupled with closure
of the lips, forcing an exit by the nasal passages, it
assumes the form <i>hm!</i>&mdash;or <i>hem!</i> as commonly written.
As commonly appearing preparatory to speaking, it
comes by association to have value in attracting attention.</p>

<p>Many of these words are, at the same time, substantives
or verbs as well; and in this case it is often
difficult to say whether the interjectional use, on the
one hand, or the nominal and verbal on the other, is
the original. For us, however, this is at present
immaterial; as long as in the one we have a real ‘original
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
creation,’ the other meaning may be a derived one.
Duplication and triplication of sounds is often employed,
and often the vowel sounds belonging to the
different syllables are differentiated by <i>ablaut</i>. Thus
<i>chit-chat</i>, <i>ding-dong</i>, <i>snip-snap</i> (Shakespeare, Love’s
Labour’s lost, V. i.), <i>tittle-tattle</i>, <i>kit-kat</i> (in ‘the Kit-kat
Club’), <i>sing-song</i>, <i>see-saw</i>, <i>gew-gaw</i>, <i>tick-tack</i>;
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clic-clac</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cric-crac</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drelin-drelon</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cahu-caha</i> (used
to express the jolting of a vehicle). Words used as
substantives only, are formed in somewhat similar pairs
as <i>hurly-burly</i>, <i>linsey-woolsey</i>, <i>hotch-potch</i>; and so also
are adverbs such as <i>helter-skelter</i>, <i>higgledy-piggledy</i>.
Old language material, too, is often employed in the
formation of such words as <i>sing-song</i>, <i>ding-dong</i>, <i>boohoo</i>,
<i>rub-a-dub</i>, <i>zig-zag</i>. We may compare also such formations
as <i>ring-a-ching-a-chink-chink</i>. There are
other words due to the same imitative impulse, which,
however, are formed according to the regular laws of
language. Such are combinations of several words
echoing the sound, and differing only in their vowels:
such as <i>flicker and flacker</i>, <i>crinkle-crankle</i>, <i>dinging and
donging</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nursery language.</i> Most nursery language is
imitative of natural sounds, and reduplication plays an
important part in the words in this; cf. <i>bow-wow</i>, <i>puff-puff</i>,
<i>gee-gee</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> This language is not invented by
children, but is received by them like any other, and
welcomed by those who have to teach infants, as facilitating
the efforts of the teacher. The relation of the
sound to the meaning which often still exists therein,
facilitates the acceptance of the word by the child to be
taught. Indeed, the words of the language of culture are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
sometimes actually compounded with words of nursery
language, as in the case of <i>moo-cow</i>, <i>baa-sheep</i>, <i>coo-dove</i>.
It must further be remarked that, when a language
has developed into a state of culture and finds it
necessary to create new words, these words accommodate
themselves to the forms already existing in
the language, and undergo processes of formation
similar to those which have operated on the words
already existing in the language. They appear with
the derivation and flection syllables common in the
language at the time when they were created. For
instance, supposing <i>cackle</i> and <i>chuckle</i> to be words of
this sort, <i>cack</i>, and <i>chuck</i> or <i>chugh</i> are the only parts
due to original creation;&mdash;the termination <i>le</i> seems a
regular iterative form, and the words have come to be
classified with others of the same formation, and
treated in the same way. Similar instances are αἰάζω
(αἰαί) οἰμώζω (οἶμοι), etc.</p>

<p><i>Roots.</i> We are led to see, then, from such forms
as <i>cackle</i>, that what we regard as a <i>root</i> need not
necessarily ever have existed as a bare root, as
an independent element; but immediately upon its
appearance, it is naturally provided with one or more
suffixes or prefixes in accordance with the exigencies
of the language. Thus, for instance, in the Middle
ages a belfry was called <i>clangorium</i>. And further,
the <i>function</i> of new creations is determined by the
analogy of other words existing in the language; and
thus the new words, as soon as they appear in the
language, conform to the laws of language, and an
element appears in the words which does not depend
upon original creation. So φεῦ forms a verb in
Æschylus, Agamemnon: τί ταῦτ’ ἔφευξας (1194; see
also line 960); cf. <i>ächzen</i> in N.H.G., and the use of
such words as <i>crack</i>, <i>crackle</i>, <i>crackling</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>In what has been said hitherto, we have mainly
considered the form in which language appears; but
neither in this nor in its syntax must we suppose that
the first creations with which language began were
operated upon by any such influences as analogy. We
must suppose them to have been entire conceptions,
condensed sentences, as when we cry out <i>Fire!</i> <i>Thieves!</i>
They are really, it will be seen, predicates; and an
impression unspoken but felt by the speaker forms
their subject. The impressions made by noises and
sounds would be those that would naturally strike first
upon man’s consciousness; and to express these he
creates the first sounds of language. The oldest
words, therefore, seem to have been imperfectly
expressed conceptions partaking of an interjectional
character.</p>

<p>Again, it must be remembered that the new
creations of primitive man must have been made with
no thought of communication. Until language was
created, those who uttered the first sounds must have
been ignorant that they could thereby indicate anything
to their neighbours. The sounds which they uttered
were simply the reflection of their own feelings, or
when they came by observation to associate with their
neighbours’ feelings. But as soon as other individuals
heard these reflex sounds, and at the same time had
the same feelings, the sounds and feelings were in some
way connected, and must have passed into the consciousness
of the community as in some measure connected
as cause and effect. We must also suppose that
gesture language developed side by side with the language
of sounds: and, indeed, it is not until language
has reached a high degree of development that it can
dispense with gesture language as an auxiliary. The
Southern nations, which use most interjections, employ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
also most gesticulations. The Portuguese language,
for instance, is exceedingly rich in interjections, and
moreover these interjections are in common use, to an
extent which at first strikes a foreigner as excessive
and almost unpleasant, but which he soon learns to
appreciate. Conversation in Portuguese often derives
a peculiar charm and picturesqueness from the frequency
with which one of the speakers expresses his
meaning, quite clearly, with some interjection (e.g. <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">ora</i>)
and some gesticulation.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>We must further remember that, as soon as a
speaker has recognised the fact that he can, by the
means of language, communicate his thoughts, there is
nothing to prevent the sounds uttered consciously as
the vehicles of communication from attaching themselves
to those which are merely involuntary expressions
of feelings. Whether the group of sounds
so produced shall disappear or survive must depend
on its suitability to fill a need, and on many chance
circumstances.</p>

<p>It should also be noticed that we must suppose the
original human being, who had never as yet spoken, to
have been absolutely unable to reutter at his will any
form of speech which he had chanced to produce. He
would slowly and gradually, after repeatedly hearing
the sound, acquire the capacity for reproducing it. The
children of our own day hear a certain number of
definite and limited sounds repeated by persons in
whom identical motory sensations have developed.</p>

<p>We are driven, therefore, to assume that language
must have begun with a confused utterance of the most
varying and uncertain articulations, such as we never
find combined in any real language. We may thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
gather that the consistency in motory sensation necessary
to a language must have been very slow in
developing.</p>

<p>The result, then, at which we arrive is that no
motory sensation can attain to a definite form and
consistency except for such sounds as are favoured by
their natural conditions. The sounds most open to be
acted on by such conditions are those immediately
resulting from the attempt to express natural feelings;
in the endeavour to express these, nature, which
prompted the feelings, must have prompted some
uniformity of utterance. The traditional language
must at its outset have contented itself with comparatively
few sound signs, even though a large quantity
of different sounds were, on different occasions, uttered
by the different individuals.</p>

<p>The process of utterance must have been long and
tedious before anything worthy to be called a language
could come into existence. A language cannot be
produced until individuals belonging to the same
linguistic community have begun to store up in memory
the product of their original creations. When they
can draw upon their memory at will, and can count
upon reproducing the same sound-groups to represent
the same ideas, and can likewise count upon these
sound-groups being understood in the same sense, then,
and not till then, can we speak of language in any true
sense.</p>

<p>If this be the true test of the existence of a language,
it is no doubt true that we must admit that many beasts
possess language. Their calls of warning or of enticement
are clearly traditional, and are learnt from those
around them. They utter the same cries to express
the same emotions, and this consistently. But the
language of beasts suffices only for the expression of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
simple and definite feeling. The language of man
consists in the grouping of several words so as to
form a sentence. Man thus develops the power of
advancing beyond simple intuition, and of pronouncing
judgment on what is not before him.

<span class="medium">ON ISOLATION AND THE REACTION AGAINST IT.</span></h2>

<p>The process of forming our modal and material groupings
of ideas, and of the terms which we use to express
those ideas, is essentially a subjective one, and is, as such,
productive of results which would seem at first sight
to be incapable of scientific generalisation. Within
the limits, however, of any given linguistic community,
the elements of which such groups can be formed are
identical, and&mdash;with all possible divergence of width
and depth of intellectual development in the members
of that community&mdash;there is a certain uniformity in
the manner in which each individual member employs
that part of the common stock of ideas and terms of
which he is master. Hence it inevitably follows that
the groups which are formed will, IF THE AVERAGE be
taken, prove about equal, and we are thus justified in
abstracting from the individual, and in generalising
concerning such grouping at any given period, in
exactly the same manner as we do in speaking of the
language of a community or of the pronunciation of
a given word by a community. In this process, we
may for our purpose neglect individual peculiarities or
deviations from that abstract and always somewhat
arbitrary norm.</p>

<p>And just as the language of any two periods of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
time shows that differences arise which permeate the
whole, so, if we compare the groupings of which we
can prove the existence in former times by the influence
they exerted on the preservation or destruction
of different forms in the language with those we can
observe at present in our own linguistic consciousness,
or with those which were prevalent at any other period
of time, we notice (1) that what formerly was naturally
connected by every member of the linguistic community
is no longer felt to belong together, and (2)
that what once formed part of different and disconnected
groups has been joined together.</p>

<p>It is the former of these two events which we have
to discuss in this chapter:<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> its chief causes are change
in sound and change in, or development of, signification.
The effects of the latter in isolating more or less
completely some word or some particular use or combination
of any word from the group with which,
owing to parallelism in meaning, it was once connected,
we have already illustrated in Chapter IV. Sound-change
has or may have similar effects, and even
the influence of analogy, which, as we have seen in
Chapter V., is mainly effectual in restoring or maintaining
the union between the members of a group, sometimes
contributes to the opposite effect when any one
particular member happens, from whatever cause it
may be, to be excluded from its operation.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, our present word <i>day</i> is found
in Anglo-Saxon <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span>

<span class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell">Nom.</span>
<span class="tcell">and Acc. Sing.</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>dæg</i></span>
<span class="tcell">Plur.</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>dagas</i></span>
</span>

<span class="tcell"><i>dæges</i></span>

<span class="tcell"><i>daga</i></span>

<span class="tcell">Dat.</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>dæge</i></span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>dagum</i>,</span>
</span></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
where <i>æ</i> was pronounced as the <i>a</i> in <i>man</i>, <i>hat</i>, etc.,
and <i>a</i> as <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>: <i>æ</i> is therefore a ‘front-vowel,’
like the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i>, etc., while <i>a</i> of <i>dagas</i> was
a ‘back-vowel,’ as are <i>o</i> or <i>u</i>.</p>

<p>The phonetic development of final or medial <i>g</i>
differs according to the vowel which preceded it. If
this was a front-vowel the <i>g</i> became <i>y</i> (vowel),<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> if it
was a back-vowel the <i>g</i> became <i>w</i>. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, A.S.
<i>hnægan</i>, E. <i>neigh</i>; A.S. <i>wegan</i>, E. <i>weigh</i>; A.S. <i>hálig</i>,
E. <i>holy</i>: but A.S. <i>búgan</i>, E. <i>(to) bow</i>; A.S. <i>boga</i>, E.
<i>bow</i>; A.S. <i>ágan</i>, E. <i>to own</i>. Accordingly <i>dæg</i>, etc., in
the singular became <i>day</i>, whilst in the plural we find
in M.E. <i>dawes</i>, etc. As soon, however, as analogy
had established the ‘regular’ <i>s</i> plural to the sing. <i>day</i>,
plur. <i>days</i>, the verb <i>(to) dawn</i>, A.S., <i>dagian</i> was thereby
isolated completely, and no speaker who is not more
or less a student of the history of English, connects
the verb with the noun.</p>

<p>Another instance maybe found in the word <i>forlorn</i>.</p>

<p>To understand the history of this word we must
know what is meant by Verner’s law.</p>

<p>Among the first illustrations of the regular correspondence
of the several consonants in Latin and in
the Teutonic languages are such pairs as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mater</i>,
<i>mother</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater</i>, <i>father</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frater</i>, <i>brother</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tres</i>, <i>three</i>;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tu</i>, <i>thou</i>: in all of which a <i>th</i> is found in English
where the Latin shows a <i>t</i>. This and other similar
regular interchanges were generalised by Grimm and
formulated by him as a law, part of which stated
that if the same word was found in Latin, Greek,
and Sanscrit, as well as in Teutonic, a <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>, in the
first three languages appeared as <i>h</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>f</i> in Low German,
of which family English is a representative.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>All our sets of examples seem to illustrate and
confirm this law. If, however, we trace the English
words back to older forms, we see that this absolute
regularity is disturbed. In Middle-English almost invariably,
and in Anglo-Saxon invariably, we find <i>fader</i>,
<i>moder</i>, <i>brother</i>, A.S. <i>fæder</i>, <i>módor</i>, <i>bróðor</i>, in perfect
agreement with O.S. <i>fadar</i>, <i>môdar</i>, <i>brothar</i>, and Goth.
<i>fadar</i>, <i>brothar</i> (cf. Mod. Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vater</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mutter</i>, but <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bruder</i>).
It was Karl Verner who explained this irregularity,
and proved that it was connected with the place of
the accent in the Teutonic languages, not as we find
it now, but as it can be proved to have existed in
those languages, where it corresponded generally
with the Greek accents, or more closely still with
the accent in Vedic Sanscrit. There we find that in
the corresponding forms <i>pitar</i>, <i>mâtar</i>, and <i>bhratar</i>,
the accent or stress lay on the <small>FIRST</small> syllable in
<i>bhratar</i>, but on the <small>LAST</small> in <i>pitar</i> and <i>mâtar</i>. Verner
proved by numerous examples that only where an
<small>ACCENTED</small> vowel preceded the <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, Teutonic showed
the corresponding <i>f</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>h</i>; but that, on the other
hand, where the preceding vowel was <small>UNACCENTED</small>,
instead of <i>f</i> we found <i>b</i>, and <i>d</i> instead of <i>th</i>, <i>g</i> instead
of <i>h</i>. And also, instead of <i>s</i>, which was elsewhere
found both in Latin or Sanscrit as well as in Teutonic,
<i>z</i> was found, which <i>z</i> further changed into <i>r</i> in Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;to give one more instance&mdash;the suffix <i>ian</i>,
used to form causatives in Teutonic, once bore the
accent, which afterwards was placed on the root-syllable.
Accordingly, the causative of the verb <i>rís-an</i>
(to rise) was once <i>rás-ian</i>,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> which, with <i>z</i>, and, later on,
<i>r</i>, instead of <i>s</i>, changed into <i>rǽr-an</i>, Mod. Eng <i>to rear</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>The so-called Grammatical change in Anglo-Saxon
(and other Teutonic languages) now becomes clear:

<span class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell">The verb</span>
<span class="tcell">in past sing.</span>
<span class="tcell">plur.</span>
<span class="tcell">p. part.</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>céosan</i> (to choose) has</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>caés</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>curon</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>coren</i></span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>sniðan</i> (to cut; Scotch, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sned</i>)</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>snáð</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>snidon</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>sniden</i></span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>téon</i> (to drag) has</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>téah</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>tugon</i></span>
<span class="tcell"><i>togen</i></span>
</span></span>

and all this series of regular sound-change depends
upon the fact that in the past plural and in the past
participle the accent fell <small>ORIGINALLY</small> on the termination.
Similarly, (<i>for</i>) <i>léosan</i>,&mdash;<i>léas</i>,&mdash;<i>luron</i>,&mdash;<i>loren</i>,
from which last form we have our word <i>forlorn</i>,
meaning, therefore, ‘completely lost.’ Already, however,
in Anglo-Saxon, in very many verbs all traces
of this grammatical change have disappeared, and the
history of the strong conjugation in Middle-English
shows the gradual supersession of the consonants in
the past plural and past participle by those found in
the present and past singular. Hence those forms
in which these older consonants remained were more
and more isolated from the groups with which they are
etymologically connected; and as little as in popular
consciousness <i>to rear</i> is grouped with <i>to rise</i>, so little
is the adjective <i>forlorn</i> thought of as a member of the
group <i>to lose</i>, <i>lost</i>, etc.</p>

<p>We have had already more than one occasion to
point out that not only words, but also syntactical
combinations and phrases can and do form matter
groups. Nay, even the various meanings of a
syntactical relation are thus combined.</p>

<p>Such a relation, for instance, is that expressed by
the genitive. Though we employ&mdash;and formerly
employed more generally than now&mdash;this case with
various meanings, all these meanings are more or less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
(rather less) consciously felt as one, or at least are
closely related&mdash;and they continue to be so felt, <i>i.e.</i>
the grouping remains a close one&mdash;as long as these
various usages remain general and what we may call
living. When, however, any one of these usages
becomes obsolete, and the relation indicated finds
another form of expression in some other syntactical
arrangement, some few examples of the older mode of
expression, strengthened as they are by, <i>e.g.</i>, very
frequent employment, remain, but cease to be felt as
instances of that relation.</p>

<p>Thus, though the meaning of the genitives in
<i>This is my father’s house</i>, and in <i>God’s goodness</i> is
essentially different&mdash;the one expressing an ownership
of one person with regard to a material external object,
the other the relation between a being and an immaterial
inherent quality,&mdash;both are felt as one kind of relation;
nay, the superficial thinker has some difficulty in fully
realising that they express really TWO meanings. More
easily felt is the difference between the Latin and
French ‘genitivus subjectivus’ and ‘genitivus objectivus:’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor patriæ</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’amour de la patrie</i> (the love for
our fatherland, <i>ob. gen.</i>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor matris</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’amour de
la mère</i> (the love which our mother feels for us,
<i>sub. gen.</i>). Yet, once more, even this difference is
not always realised by every one who uses both
constructions. Another use of the genitive once
was to form adverbs. As long as any genitive
could be thus employed, we may be sure that the
ordinary speaker will have grouped, when thus using
it, not only the particular form with other cases of the
same noun, etc., but also the genitives, as such, with
other genitives. When, however, other modes of
forming the adverbs prevailed, the old genitival
adverbs which remained were no longer felt as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
genitives, and became isolated and no longer productive
as examples for other formations. A remnant
of this genitive survives in <i>needs</i>, and perhaps in
Shakespeare’s <i>Come a little nearer this ways</i> (Merry
Wives, II. ii.; ed. Collier);<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> in <i>straightways</i>, and
certainly in M.E. <i>his thankes</i>, <i>here unthankes</i> (libenter,
ingratis), or A.S. <i>heora ágnes ðances</i> (eorum voluntate).
It further survives in adverbs derived from adjectives:
<i>else</i> (from an adj. pron. <i>el</i>) <i>unawares</i>, <i>inwards</i>,
<i>upwards</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly the preposition <i>of</i>, which early began to
serve as a substitute for the genitive, has been
employed in some adverbial and other expressions.
This usage, however, if it ever was really “alive,”
is now completely dead. We find <i>I must of force</i>
(Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV., II. ii.) and <i>my custom
always of the afternoon</i> (Hamlet, I. v.); and still can
say <i>of an evening</i>; <i>all of a sudden</i>; but not, e.g., <i>of a
moment</i>. Nor should we now imitate Shakespeare’s
<i>not be seen to wink of all the day</i> (Love’s Labour’s Lost,
I. i. 43); <i>Did you not of late days hear</i> (Henry VIII.,
II. i. 147), though we still have <i>of late</i>, <i>of old</i>.</p>

<p>Many other prepositions offer in their constructions
illustrations of isolation. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the combination
of any preposition with a noun without an article was
exceedingly common in the older language, and we
still possess a numerous collection of such combinations
in almost daily use. Thus we find <i>indeed</i>, <i>in
fact</i>, <i>in truth</i>, <i>in reality</i>, <i>in jest</i>, etc., a construction
which perhaps may yet be considered a living one
when the noun is an abstraction. Adverbs of place,
however, such as <i>in bed</i>, <i>in church</i>, are no longer
formed at will: no one would say <i>in house</i>, <i>in room</i>.</p>

<p>So, again, we have <i>at home</i>, <i>at sea</i>, <i>at hand</i>, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
not <i>at house</i>,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> <i>at water</i>, <i>at foot</i>. We can throw something
<i>overboard</i>, but not <i>over wall</i> or <i>over river</i>. We
can stand <i>on shore</i>, <i>on land</i>, <i>on foot</i>, <i>on board</i>, but do
not speak of standing <i>on bank</i>, <i>on ship</i>. We can sit
<i>at table</i>, not <i>at sideboard</i>. One may come <i>to grief</i>, <i>to
ruin</i>, but cannot omit <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> in <i>come to ... death</i>.
We can say <i>by night</i>, <i>by day</i>, <i>by this day week</i>, but not
<i>by spring</i>, <i>by winter</i>. Lastly: we travel <i>by land</i>, <i>by sea</i>,
<i>by water</i>, <i>by rail</i>; we send a packet <i>by parcel delivery</i>;
we communicate <i>by letter</i>, or <i>by word of mouth</i>, but
should not ask for information by saying, <i>Let me
know by line</i> (instead of <i>by a line</i>), <i>will you?</i></p>

<p>In the isolation of the genitives, which we discussed
above, and in all similar syntactical isolations, it would
perhaps be correct to distinguish two phases of development,
or&mdash;as they are not necessarily chronologically
separated&mdash;two sides of the same process. For
while in course of time, as we have seen, one of the
<small>SYNTACTICAL MEANINGS OF THE GENITIVE CASE</small> became
isolated from the other relationships expressed by that
same case, we must, on the other hand, also remember
that this involved an isolation of certain formal or modal
groups (in this case, of &mdash;s forms) from their historical
nominatives, which in most cases in its turn caused, or
was accompanied by, a more or less clearly marked
separation in development of meanings. When the
genitive case was no longer generally employed to
form adverbs from nouns and adjectives, words like
<i>needs</i>, <i>straightways</i>, <i>else</i>, <i>upwards</i>, were no longer felt
as genitives, and we now feel that the adverb <i>needs</i> is
not in our consciousness grouped with the noun <i>need</i>,
in the same way as, for instance, the nom. plur. <i>needs</i>
with the sing. <i>need</i>; nay, if we carefully examine
the meaning of the adverb, we find that its material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
meaning no longer completely coincides with that of
the noun.</p>

<p>The various meanings of the <small>NOUN</small> <i>need</i> are
<i>urgent want</i>, <i>poverty</i>, <i>position of difficulty</i>, <i>distress</i>,
<i>necessity</i>, <i>compulsion</i>; the <small>ADVERB</small> answers only to the
last two: <i>He must needs go</i> could not be used for <i>He
must go on account of urgent want</i>, or <i>as a consequence
of poverty or distress</i>, but only for <i>He must go of
necessity</i>, <i>indispensably</i>, <i>inevitably</i>.</p>

<p>Such formal isolation, then, is almost always at the
same time a material one. Thus, we may say that
the noun <i>tilth</i> is not so intimately connected with the
group <i>I till</i>, <i>tilling</i>, <i>well tilled</i>, etc., as, e.g., <i>writing</i> is
connected with <i>to write</i>, etc.; and this because the
suffix <i>-ing</i> is a living and productive one, <i>i.e.</i> one
which still forms verbal nouns at our will, whenever
the need arises, and from whatever verb; whilst the
suffix <i>th</i> is no longer so used, being at the present
day comparatively rare in English (<i>health</i>, <i>wealth</i>,
<i>strength</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>breath</i>, <i>width</i>), and, indeed, more often
occurring as an adjectival than as a verbal suffix.</p>

<p>The closest groups are naturally always those consisting
of the different inflected forms of the same
noun or verb, and the ties connecting the members of
such a group are undoubtedly stronger than those
between words of different functions, etymologically
connected, but whose mode of formation or derivation
is not so vividly realised by the ordinary speaker.
This is so true, that the same form, when used as
present participle, must be said to be more closely
connected with the other parts of the verb than when
used as an adjective; and this can be proved by the
fact that often such an adjective has undergone changes
in meaning in which the verb and even the present
participle, as such, has not participated. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the present part. <i>living</i>, in ‘he is living,’ whether we
mean this for ‘he is alive’ or ‘he is dwelling in ...’
has the same usage as the verb <i>he lives</i>, and no
more. This is, however, no longer true of the <small>ADJECTIVE</small>
<i>living</i>, in a phrase like ‘I give you living water.’
To realise this we need but replace the adjective by a
relative clause, ‘which lives,’ when we at once feel that
we extend the use of the verb in an unusual way. Thus,
again, the <small>NOUN</small> <i>writing</i>, in ‘These are the writings
of ...’ for ‘These are his (perhaps printed) works,’
has an application which we could not give to the
verb <i>to write</i>.</p>

<p>This illustrates the fact that a development in
meaning of a derivative is not necessarily shared by
or transferred to the primary word, whilst any extension
of usage of such parent-word is likely to spread
to its derivatives. The same is of course true of
simple and compound words. Hence the process of
isolation of derivative from primary, or compound from
simple, generally originates in change of meaning in
the former of each of these groups. Thus, the noun
<i>undertaker</i> is isolated from the verb <i>to undertake</i> in
consequence of a restriction of its meaning to the
person who makes it his profession to undertake the
management, etc., of funerals. So, again, though the
noun <i>keeper</i> = guardian, watchman, protector, is applied
to a certain gold ring, we could hardly say that such a
ring <i>keeps</i> the others. A <i>beggar</i>, originally ‘one who
begs,’ is now one who ‘habitually begs and obtains his
living by doing so,’ while, if ever we do apply the
term in the wider and older sense, we often indicate&mdash;in
writing at least&mdash;the closer connection with the verb
<i>to beg</i> by using the termination <i>er</i>, the characteristic
termination of the nomen agentis <i>begger</i>. There is,
in German, a very interesting word which illustrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
this fact to an extent which it would be difficult to
parallel completely in English. By the side of the
verb <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">reiten</i>, ‘to ride,’ a noun <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ritter</i> exists, of which the
original meaning was merely <i>a rider</i>. Like our word
‘beggar,’ this <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ritter</i> was specialised in meaning, and
applied to one who rides habitually and as a profession,
<i>i.e.</i> a warrior who fights on horseback. When these
warriors began to form a privileged body (an order to
which many were admitted who never, at least professionally,
rode) the noun attained a meaning to which
no verb could correspond.</p>

<p>Again, some adverbs, especially such as emphasise
our expressions, have developed in meaning often
much further than the primary adjective has followed
them. Thus <i>very</i>, as adverb a mere emphatic word,
has, as adjective, retained much more fully its original
meaning of <i>true</i>: cf. <i>this is very true</i>, <i>very false</i>, with,
<i>a very giant</i>. It is the same with the adverb <i>awfully</i>,
now indeed common, but noted by Charles Lamb as a
Scotticism, and with the adjective <i>sore</i>, and the adverb
<i>sorely</i>.</p>

<p>It is, however, not <i>always</i> the derivative which, in
its isolation, assumes the modified signification. The
primitive may change, and the derivative remain
stationary. Thus the English <i>shop</i>, as a place for
retail trade, has been displaced in America by <i>store</i>,
while <i>shop</i> comes to have the value of <i>work-shop</i>,
<i>machine-shop</i>, etc. Yet the derivative <i>shopping</i>, a much-used
word in America, retains a reminiscence of the
older value of <i>shop</i>.</p>

<p>To return for a moment to the example which we
gave from German: the verb <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">reiten</i> (pronounced with
a vowel sound closely resembling that of <i>i</i> in <i>to ride</i>)
and the noun <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ritter</i> (<i>i</i> nearly like <i>i</i> in <i>rid</i>, or, more
correctly, like <i>ee</i> of <i>need</i>, but shortened), show a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
gradation of vowel-sound, of the same nature and
origin as that in such pairs as <i>write</i>, <i>wrote</i>; <i>sing</i>,
<i>sang</i>; <i>give</i>, <i>gave</i>. This change in vowel-sound without
doubt co-operated in effecting the isolation, and so
facilitated the change in meaning in the one form; a
change in which the other did not participate. Thus,
speaking generally, phonetic development, by creating
numerous meaningless distinctions, loosens the modal
and material groups, and serves to forward isolation of
meaning. Thus, again, the special meaning which
we now attach to the verb <i>to rear</i> would have been
more likely to transfer itself to the primary verb <i>to rise</i>,
or&mdash;<i>vice versâ</i>&mdash;the meaning of the primary <i>to rise</i>
would have almost certainly prevented the special
development of <i>to rear</i>, if the etymological connection
had not been obscured by the phonetic development
which we formulate as Verner’s law, <i>i.e.</i> if the
grouping had not been loosened.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, clear that if, from whatever cause,
an interchange of certain sounds becomes less frequent
in a language, those words which do preserve that
interchange become <i>ipso facto</i> more strongly separated.
Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>umlaut</i>, i.e. the change of <i>u</i> (sounded as <i>oo</i>)
to <i>ü</i> (sounded as <i>u</i> in French, the Devonshire <i>u</i>; more
like English <i>ee</i> than like English <i>u</i>), or of <i>a</i> (<i>a</i> as in
<i>father</i>) to <i>ä</i> (sound much like <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, but without the
<i>ee</i> sound which in English follows it), etc., is in German
so common that in no case is its presence or absence
alone sufficient to effect the isolation of any form from
its related group. In English, this interchange has
almost completely disappeared, and the few traces
of it which we preserve in the plural formation (<i>foot</i>,
<i>feet</i>; <i>tooth</i>, <i>teeth</i>; <i>mouse</i>, <i>mice</i>; <i>man</i>, <i>men</i>, etc.) are
only preserved as so-called ‘irregularities,’ and no
longer form a model or pattern for other formations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Hence in English, where, besides <i>umlaut</i>, we have
difference in function (<i>e.g.</i> adjective and noun), the
isolation has often been complete. Thus, no ordinary
speaker groups the adjective <i>foul</i> with the noun <i>filth</i>;
and the connection, though still felt, between <i>long</i>
and <i>length</i>, <i>broad</i> and <i>breadth</i>, is undoubtedly less
clearly felt than between, e.g., <i>long</i> and <i>longer</i>, or
<i>broad</i> and <i>to broaden</i>, <i>high</i> and <i>height</i>: similarly, the
difference in vowel between <i>weal</i> and <i>wealth</i>, <i>(to) heal</i>
and <i>health</i>, has facilitated isolation of these forms.</p>

<p>If phonetic development were the only agent in the
history of language, we see that, shortly, an infinite
variety of forms, absolutely unconnected, or at best
but loosely connected, would be the result. But here,
as always, we have action and counteraction.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> This
counteracting influence is chiefly exerted by analogy,
as we explained in Chapter V. It is, however, not
always analogy which brings about the readjustment
or unification.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to point out that
our word-division, though undoubtedly based on real
and sufficient grounds, is not consistently or even
commonly observed in <small>SPEAKING</small>. Our thoughts are,
indeed, expressed not in words but in <i>word-groups</i>;
and letters, even though they stand at the end or at
the beginning of words, have often had a special
phonetic development, in cases where these words
occurred in very frequent or in very intimate connection
with other words. The differences so created
have very commonly, though not by any means
universally, found expression in writing. As an
instance of a differentiation of which the written
language takes no cognisance, we may take the French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
indefinite article. Few are unaware that when <i>un</i>
stands before a consonant the <i>n</i> is not pronounced,
leaving in the spoken word only a trace of its existence
in the fact that the vowel is nasalised. When <i>un</i> comes
before a vowel, on the other hand, the vowel is much
less strongly, if at all, nasalised, and the <i>n</i> is clearly
pronounced. Thus (using the circumflex to indicate
the nasal quality of the vowel and <i>ö</i> for the sound of
<i>u</i> in <i>un</i>), <i>un père</i> = <i>ö̂ père</i>, but <i>un ami</i> = <i>ön ami</i> or <i>ö̂n
ami</i>. The corresponding difference which exists in
English is expressed in writing: <i>a father</i>, <i>an aunt</i>.</p>

<p>Just as the article is closely connected with the
noun, so preposition and noun, or preposition and
verb, are very intimately connected in pronunciation.
Hence&mdash;though many, who have never carefully observed
either their own pronunciation or that of others,
may dispute or deny the assertion&mdash;in <small>ORDINARY</small> conversation,
in the phrases, <i>in town</i>, <i>in doors</i>, we employ
the <i>n</i> sound; but when the word <i>in</i> stands before <i>Paris</i>
and <i>Berlin</i>, we use an <i>m</i> sound, just as we say <i>impossible</i>
by the side of <i>interest</i>. Similarly, we pronounce
generally ‘in coming’ with <i>ng</i> for <i>n</i>, just as we speak
of a man’s <i>ingcome</i>. This differentiation of the pronunciation
of the preposition <i>in</i> into three forms&mdash;<i>in</i>, <i>im</i>,
<i>ing</i>&mdash;is not, however, consistently expressed by us in
writing. The Greeks, on the other hand, who similarly
differentiated the terminal consonants of the prepositions
in their spoken language, but on a much larger
scale (accustomed as they were to a far closer
correspondence between their spoken and their written
language than the Englishman observes), did actually, in
many cases, write as they spoke: κάδ δὲ,&mdash;κὰκ κεφαλὴν,
κὰγ γόνυ&mdash;κὰπ πεδιόν, etc., instead of employing the normal
form of the preposition, κατά. So we find in inscriptions
τὴμ πόλιν, τὴγ γυναῖκα, τὸλ λογόν, ἐμ πόλει, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>The first step on the road towards unification is
frequently that the external reason which caused the
difference in form, disappears or loses force, and one
form is found in connections where, historically or
phonetically speaking, the other is correct. We may
instance this by the common mistake of children when
they say, e.g., <i>a apple</i> instead of <i>an apple</i>. In this case,
however, the correct form is so very frequently heard
that the encroachment of <i>a</i> on the domains of <i>an</i> is not
likely to lead to permanent confusion. Where, however,
circumstances are less favourable to the preservation
of the historically correct usage, it happens that
either form encroaches on the domain of the other, or
else it may result that the encroachment is reciprocal,&mdash;when,
after a period of confusion in which both forms
are used indifferently, one becomes obsolete and falls
into oblivion, not without often leaving some striking
form or phrase to testify to what once existed. Thus,
for instance, our word <i>here</i>, Old High German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hier</i>,
or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hêr</i>, was, in the period of transition from Old to
Middle High German, differentiated in accordance
with a phonetic law of that time, viz. that final <i>r</i> was
dropped after a long vowel. If not final however, <i>r</i>
remained untouched, and this whether it stood in the
body of a word or within a group of intimately connected
words. Of the two forms <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hie</i> and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hier</i>, the
former, as the form employed when the word was used
independently, was in Middle High German often set
before words beginning with a vowel; and we find <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hie
inne</i> (= here-in) or even, by contraction, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hinne</i>, for <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hier-inne</i>.
On the other hand, it is probably owing to the
frequency of combinations similar and equivalent to
our <i>here-in</i>, <i>here-upon</i>, etc., that the form <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hier</i>
encroached successfully upon the domain of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hie</i>, and
finally supplanted it. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hie</i>, however, remained, singularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
enough, in the one expression <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hie und da</i> (here
and there), where the form without <i>r</i> is not and
has never been, phonetically speaking, correct. An
excellent example of this differentiation is furnished
by <i>one</i>, <i>an</i>.</p>

<p>The best example of the process is furnished by the
history of the working of Verner’s law, and of the gradual
disappearance of its effects. We have before (pp. 172,
173) explained this law and quoted instances of forms
created in agreement with it, which have now been
replaced by others. To repeat this explanation here
with other examples would be superfluous; to give a
full history, even confining ourselves to an enumeration
of all the various ways in which it has been operative
and the areas of its influence, would transcend the
scope of this work. To carefully note all instances of
its occurrence and its neglect, and to closely investigate
the possible courses of the latter, is a task which may
most usefully challenge the attention of philologists.
We will illustrate the truth of this by a single example:
(though even this we cannot discuss exhaustively).
The forms which we employ at present as the past
tense of the verb <i>to be</i>&mdash;sing. <i>was</i> and plur. (with
grammatical change according to the law) <i>were</i>, belong
to a root which in old English and Anglo-Saxon
furnished a complete verb: pres. <i>wese</i>, past. <i>wæs</i>,
p. part. <i>wesen</i>. Now we should naturally expect that
in a time when the grammatical change was still preserved
in

we should also find that change here, and that accordingly
the past participle should be *<i>weren</i>. That such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
a form once existed is proved by the past participle
<i>forweorone</i> (cf. Sievers, Anglo-Saxon Grammar, § 391).
Everywhere, however, in Anglo-Saxon, in the past
participle of this verb and in that of all similarly conjugated,
such as <i>lesan</i>, <i>læs</i>, <i>lesen</i>; <i>genesan</i>, <i>genæs</i>, <i>genesen</i>,
etc., the <i>s</i> has once more been fully established.
The fact that <i>these</i> past participles had already so
far proceeded on the road to unification, while the
others as yet remained isolated, may be explained in
this way,&mdash;the latter, <small>IN ADDITION</small> to the differentiation
in accordance with Verner’s law, showed a difference of
vowel-sound, which in the case of others did not exist.
Hence the forms differentiated in two distinct ways
were able to resist the tendency towards unification
long after those which differed only in one respect had
succumbed. In fact, of the former we still have such
remnants as <i>forlorn</i>, from <i>to lose</i>; <i>sodden</i>, from <i>to seethe</i>.
We may formulate the result which we have illustrated,
thus: <i>The greater the phonetic distance of two differentiated
forms, the greater is the power of resistance against
unification and equalisation</i>.</p>

<p>But the <small>ORDER</small> in which we see the traces of the
working of Verner’s law disappear one after another,
and the study of such few remnants as still exist, brings
out two other general truths concerning unification.
We may without hesitation affirm that, close as is the
etymological connection between the various tenses of
the same verb, or, to speak perhaps more correctly, that
clearly as that connection is felt by the speech-making
community, it is still more strongly felt as between the
various forms of the same tense, or the various cases
of the same noun. Now, it is against the differentiation
between the members of these most intimate
groups that unification first takes place. In the declension
of the noun, where nothing but the operation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Verner’s law had separated the various cases, the re-assimilation
first took place, and though we can prove
that, in this case also, the differences actually once
existed&mdash;in the historic periods of the Teutonic dialects
almost all traces thereof have been obliterated. In the
past tenses of the verbs they are still at first found,
supported as the differentiation had been by that other
force&mdash;the gradation of vowels (the ‘ablaut’).<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> But
again: unification between the singular and plural of
the past tense took place first in cases where the
vowels were alike in both, and next in those where the
vowels differed&mdash;and again, this occurred <i>before</i> the
unification of the past participle with the whole group.
In agreement with this same rule, that very difference
of vowel-sound has completely disappeared in all
past singulars and plurals, even where&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, in
German generally&mdash;the past participle still preserves
the ‘ablaut.’</p>

<p>We can then lay it down as a second rule, <i>that
the closer the etymological connection is between differentiated
forms, the sooner will unification be effected</i>;
whilst a consideration of such rare instances as the
preservation of the interchange of <i>s</i> and <i>r</i> in <i>I was</i>, <i>we
were</i>, which is clearly due to the very exceptional frequency
with which these forms must always have been
used, and the consequent firmness with which they are
impressed on every speaker’s memory, exhibits a third
law, viz. <i>that the greater the intensity with which differentiated
forms are impressed upon the minds of the community,
the greater will prove their power of resistance
against unification</i>.</p>

<p>It is further evident that in cases where the differentiation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of form had been accompanied by one in
meaning, the tendency towards unification was counteracted,
or rather can never have existed. Thus, the
pair of words <i>glass</i> (etymologically = the shining substance)
and <i>glare</i> (to shine) is separated once and for
ever. We have seen the plur. <i>dawes</i> re-united to sing.
<i>day</i>; the verb <i>to dawn</i> has not followed suit.</p>

<p>Though thus much is clear, and when once apprehended,
almost self-evident, we must acknowledge that
much is as yet obscure and unexplained. It is often
already very difficult to find any reason why in one
case unification has taken place and not in another,
which apparently presented the same conditions: it
is generally harder still to find an answer to the question
why in any given case one form has prevailed
over another, instead of the converse having happened.
Omniscience alone could answer all such questions:
but here, again, a few general observations may serve
to explain some points, though, as we have said, much
as yet remains inexplicable. Thus, for example, when
unification replaces the confusion which followed differentiation,
members of the same formal or modal group
(that is to say, for instance, the same parts of speech)
are likely to follow in the same direction. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>,
in the original Teutonic, when the suffix <i>no</i> was preceded
by a vowel, that vowel varied in the different
(strong and weak) cases of the declensions of nouns,
adjectives, and participles, according to fixed rules,
between <i>u</i> and <i>e</i>. This <i>u</i> developed into <i>o</i> or <i>a</i>, and
<i>e</i> into <i>i</i>. Soon unification took place, in some cases in
one, in others in another direction, so that we find, for
instance, in Gothic a form like <i>ðiud</i><small>A</small><i>ns</i> (king) by the
side of <i>maurg</i><small>I</small><i>ns</i> (morning), whilst now, the past participles
(formed with this same suffix) all have <i>ans</i>
throughout; such participles as became pure adjectives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
or nouns have often <i>ins</i>, e.g. <i>gafulgins</i> (adj. ‘secret’),
past participle, of <i>filhan</i>, ‘to hide,’ with <i>fulhans</i> as
past participle, = hidden; <i>aigin</i> (neuter, hence without
<i>s</i> in nom.) = property, is past participle of <i>aigan</i>,
‘to have.’</p>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;as, for instance, in the singular and
plural of past tense in strong verbs&mdash;a differentiation
coincides with difference in function, though its origin
was independent of any such functional divergence.
This, of course, strengthens the phonetic differentiation,
and, if such a coincidence affects simultaneously
a formal group of large extent, and thus becomes a
model for analogical formations (Chap. V.), the originally
meaningless phonetic divergence may become indissolubly
associated with difference of function, and so
become expressive of the latter.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, the words <i>tooth</i>, <i>foot</i>, and <i>man</i>
form their plural <i>teeth</i>, <i>feet</i>, and <i>men</i> by <i>umlaut</i>, and by
<i>umlaut</i> alone. This modification of the vowel is, then,
here expressive of plurality. Originally, however, it
was not so. In Anglo-Saxon the declension was&mdash;

When once the combined force of nominative, accusative,
and genitive had ousted the modified vowel
from the dative singular, the whole singular exhibited
<i>ó</i> (<i>a</i>) in contrast to the nominative and accusative
plural with <i>é</i> (<i>e</i>). This caused the transference of the
latter to the genitive and dative plural also, and thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
invested the modification with a force originally quite
foreign to it.</p>

<p>In English, no doubt owing to the mixed influence
upon that language of two very different grammatical
systems (the Teutonic of Anglo-Saxon, and the Romance
of Norman-French), unification has proceeded
to a far greater length than in most other Teutonic dialects.
In German, <i>e.g.</i>, the history of the <i>umlaut</i> and
the origin of plurals in <i>er</i>&mdash;of which English has no
trace but the provincialism <i>childer</i>, or the “correct”
form <i>children</i>&mdash;furnish examples of what we have said;
and students of German will find a careful investigation
of that history both interesting and instructive.

<span class="medium">THE FORMATION OF NEW GROUPS.</span></h2>

<p>The effect of sound-change is to produce differences in
language where none previously existed; but it likewise
tends to cancel existing differences, and to cause forms
originally distinct to resemble each other or actually to
coincide. Now, symmetry and uniformity are clearly
an aid to the memory, when attained by the abolition
of useless and purposeless differences. It is, for
instance, in English, far simpler to state, and far more
easy to remember the statement, that all plurals are
formed by adding <i>s</i> to the singular, than that some are
formed in <i>-n</i>, or <i>-en</i>, or by such modifications as <i>man</i>,
<i>men</i>; <i>foot</i>, <i>feet</i>; etc.: and it is therefore a gain to
language when such forms as <i>shoon</i>, <i>eyen</i>, etc., disappear
in favour of such forms as <i>shoes</i>, <i>eyes</i>, etc. On the
other hand, the cancelling of such differences when
they serve to mark different functions is naturally disadvantageous
and tends to obscurity. When a sound
which marked such a functional difference disappears,
or when of two words or forms which had different
meanings one becomes obsolete, and the other is
employed to do service for both, it is clear that
language cannot but be the loser by dispensing with
an important aid to clearness and distinction. Thus,
of the two forms <i>mot</i> and <i>moste</i>, the former has now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
disappeared, and the latter, in the form <i>must</i>, serves to
indicate both the present and the past tense. The
effect of this ambiguity is that where we wish to clearly
indicate the past of <i>must</i>, we have to employ some
idiom in which <i>must</i> has no place; as ‘was obliged to,’
‘had to,’ ‘was constrained to,’ etc. Similarly, the loss
of the plural <i>s</i> in very many French nouns (which <i>s</i>,
though still written, is seldom sounded) would create
ambiguity were it not that the difference of the article
attached to the noun marks the difference, and to a
large extent remedies the evil; cf. <i>l’ami</i>, <i>les amis</i>.</p>

<p>The remedy, however, for such obscurity is not
always to be found in the context. Sometimes, indeed,
the evil brings its own cure; changes arise which
enable the necessary distinctions to be once more felt
and maintained, creating new forms by analogy with
other forms (see Chapter V.): but, on the other hand,
it frequently occurs that the evil remains, and a confusion
follows in the grouping of the words; which
grouping, as we have seen, is all-important in the life
history of the members of the group.</p>

<p>We must in this chapter endeavour to study some
of the results of this confusion, and consequent re-arrangement
in the groups; and to distinguish the
cases where similarity caused by phonetic development
affects the matter-groups from those where the modal-groups
are influenced.</p>

<p>I. i. There are many cases where words connected
neither by etymology nor by signification fall into the
same form.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of this similarity in form, the words
remain perfectly distinct in the linguistic consciousness
of a speaker of ordinary intelligence. Such are,
<i>e.g.</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>a.</i> <i>Hale</i>, in such a phrase as <i>hale and hearty</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
This word is of Scandinavian<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> origin (cf. Icelandic <i>heill</i>),
and represents the Anglo-Saxon <i>hál</i>, to which word
we owe the misspelt word <i>whole</i>. <i>b.</i> <i>Hale</i>, ‘to drag,’
found in Middle-English as <i>halien</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>a.</i> <i>Whole</i> = A.S. <i>hál</i>; see above. <i>b.</i> <i>Hole</i> =
A.S. <i>hol</i>, ‘a cave.’<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>3. <i>a.</i> <i>Grave</i> (A.S. <i>gráfan</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Grave</i> (Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grave</i>,
Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gravem</i>).<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>4. <i>a.</i> <i>Cope</i> (O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cape</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Cope</i> (Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">koopen</i> =
to <i>bargain, to chaffer, to buy, to vie with</i>).</p>

<p>5. <i>a.</i> <i>Stile</i> (A.S. <i>stigel</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Stile</i> (commonly
misspelt <i>style</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stilum</i>).</p>

<p>6. <i>a.</i> <i>Well</i>, adverb (A.S. <i>wel</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Well</i>, noun
(A.S. <i>wella</i>).</p>

<p>7. <i>a.</i> <i>Arm</i> (Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arma</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Arm</i>, the limb, cognate
with Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">arm</i>.</p>

<p>8. <i>a.</i> <i>Lay</i> (A.S. <i>lecgan</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Lay</i> (O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lais</i>,
‘song’).</p>

<p>9. <i>a.</i> <i>Pale</i> (Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pal</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pāum</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Pale</i> (Fr.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâle</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallidum</i>).</p>

<p>10. <i>a.</i> <i>Elder</i>, the tree (A.S. <i>ellarn</i>). <i>b.</i> <i>Elder</i>,
‘older.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>It would, of course, be possible to extend this list to
almost any length; but this would be useless for our
purpose, which is to investigate solely those cases in
which similarity causes confusion. This happens where
the difference in origin and meaning is lost sight of.
It is naturally impossible to draw a hard and fast line
of demarcation between the case just discussed and
that which we are about to exemplify, as one speaker
may keep distinct what another may confuse or treat
as identical. Still, no one, we may fairly say, unless
he be a student of language, or unless he has been
expressly informed, is aware that in a phrase like <i>The
ship is bound for London</i>, the word <i>bound</i> employed by
him has absolutely no connection with the past participle
of the verb <i>to bind</i>. In the first case, <i>bound</i> is of
Scandinavian origin, and meant originally <i>ready</i>, <i>prepared</i>;
cf. the Icelandic verb <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">búa</i>, perf. part, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">búinn</i>, ‘to
prepare.’ Similarly, few ordinary speakers can explain,
or indeed realise, the existence of the distinction in
meaning between <i>shed</i>, ‘a hut’ (a doublet of <i>shade</i>),
and <i>shed</i> in <i>water-shed</i>, when derived from the A.S.
<i>scéadan</i>; or that between <i>sheer</i>, allied to Icelandic
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">skærr</i>, ‘bright,’ and <i>sheer</i>, akin to Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">scheren</i>, ‘to
shave.’ Thus, again, many might suppose that some
etymological connection existed between <i>hide</i>, ‘a skin’
(A.S. <i>hýd</i>, akin to Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">haut</i>), and <i>hide</i>, ‘to conceal’
(A.S. <i>hídan</i>); while others, when told that <i>hide</i> also
served as the name for a certain measure of land,
might naturally even suspect some allusion to the
famous legend of the foundation of Byrsa or Carthage.
The A.S. noun <i>setl</i> (a seat) and the verb <i>settan</i> survive
both in the word <i>settle</i> and in <i>to settle</i>. In employing,
however, the word in ‘to settle a dispute,’ we have a
word of very different origin: the A.S. <i>sacu</i>, ‘a quarrel,’
‘dispute,’ ‘lawsuit’ (surviving in ‘for my <i>sake</i>’, etc.),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
existed side by side with a verb <i>sacan</i>, ‘to strive,’ or
‘dispute:’ akin to this, we find <i>saht</i>, a substantive
which owes its meaning, ‘reconciliation,’ to the development
<i>lawsuit</i>, <i>adjustment by lawsuit</i>, etc. Again,
derived from this we have the verb <i>sahtlian</i>, ‘to
reconcile,’ which, at a later period, occurs in the forms
<i>saztlen</i> and <i>sattle</i>.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> When this verb ceased to be
understood, confusion with the other verb <i>to settle</i> =
<i>to fix</i>, <i>to arrange</i>, arose, and the two forms ‘flowed
together, just as two drops of rain running down a
window-pane are very likely to run into one.’<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
Another instance of this nature is discussed by Professor
Skeat, s.v.; viz., <i>sound</i> = A.S. <i>sund</i>, akin to the Ger.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">(ge)sund</i>; <i>sound</i>, ‘a strait of the sea,’ and <i>sound</i>’ M.E.
<i>soun</i>, Anglo-Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soun</i> or <i>sun</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sonum</i>.</p>

<p>ii. Such forms, where phonetic development brought
about merely a close resemblance without producing
perfect similarity, and where, as a next step, one or
other of the set of words underwent some change more
or less violent in consequence of its supposed connection
with the rest, are peculiarly instructive, proving as
they do the confusion which arose in the minds of the
speakers who thus combined what was distinct and
unconnected. In these cases we have entered upon
the domain of ‘popular etymology,’ to which we have
already incidentally alluded.</p>

<p>It does not, however, always follow that the
supposed connection in meaning&mdash;in other words, the
coalescence of elements of different origin into a single
material group, brings about the further change in
form; at this period nothing but the linguistic consciousness
of the speaker can decide whether the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
‘popular etymology’ is or has been at work. Of
course, as long as the etymology of the different words
in the set is clearly understood by the speaker, there
can be no question as to the connection, but when one
or more of the members of the set is no longer understood
in its historical bearings, it is possible for a new
grouping to arise.</p>

<p>Let us take, as an instance, the word <i>carousal</i>.
This bore originally the sense which it bears in the
Parisian name of the <i>Place du Carrousel</i>, viz. a tournament
or festival. It was confused with the word
<i>carouse</i> (Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gar-aus</i> = properly ‘quite out,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘empty
your glasses’); and at present our word <i>carousal</i>
represents both. The Anglo-Saxon word <i>bonda</i> meant
a boor, or householder. His tenure appears expressed
in Low Latin by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bondagium</i>, and it is only
to a supposed, but wholly erroneous connection with
<i>bond</i> and the verb <i>to bind</i>, that our present word
<i>bondage</i> owes its sense of <i>servitude</i>.</p>

<p>The Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sursis</i> gave us, before its final <i>s</i> had
ceased to be pronounced, our verb <i>surcease</i>, which
most speakers now look on as a compound of <i>cease</i>
(Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cesser</i>).<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> <i>Wiseacre</i>, really derived through the
Dutch from the Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wízago</i> (A.S. <i>witega</i>, ‘a prophet’),
was already, while on its way to England, misunderstood
in Holland, and taken to be a compound of <i>wise</i>.
In Dutch, a verb <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wys-seggen</i> and a noun <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wys-segger</i>
(‘to speak wisely’ and ‘a wise sayer’) were formed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and modern German as well possesses the word
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">weissagen</i>, ‘to prophesy.’ This <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wys-segger</i>, when it
reached England, could no longer be understood as a
derivative from the verb <i>secgan</i>, which in English had
already lost its guttural and had become <i>(to) say</i>; and
thus popular etymology altered the second part of the
supposed compound into the meaningless <i>acre</i>. The
Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surlonge</i>, the piece of meat ‘upon the loin’ (Lat.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super</i>, Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur</i>, and Lat. *<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lumbea</i>, from <i>lumbus</i>, Fr.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longe</i>), became in English the <i>surloyn</i> in the time of
Henry VI. This was no longer understood; the word
was accepted as a compound with the word <i>sir</i>, and thus
the fable was invented of the ‘merry monarch’ knighting
the loin.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berfroit</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belefreit</i> of Old French
is of German origin, and signifies a watchtower. The
word had ceased to be understood, and its origin was
forgotten; but, as many towers contained a bell or a
peal of bells, a supposed connection with these bells
caused the word to be changed into <i>belfry</i>. The
spelling is affected in <i>sovereign</i>, where the <i>g</i> is due to
a supposed connection with <i>to reign</i> (<i>régner</i>, <i>regnare</i>);
the real derivation being from <i>soverain</i> (<i>superaneum</i>),
and the word being correctly spelt <i>sovran</i> by Milton.
Further instances are <i>lance-knight</i> (= <i>lanz-knecht</i> =
<i>landes knecht</i> = ‘the <i>knight</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>man</i>-of the <i>land</i>,’
‘the servant of his country’); <i>cray-fish</i> (= <i>écrévisse</i>);
<i>shamefaced</i> (really <i>shamefast</i>, like <i>steadfast</i>), etc.</p>

<p>In other cases of rarer occurrence than those which
we have discussed, a significant part of a compound
assumes the form of a mere derivative. This has
occurred in the case of the word <i>righteous</i>, taken to be
a derivative from some French adjective in <i>-eux</i>, Lat.
<i>-osus</i>, though really due to <i>right-wise</i>, a compound like
<i>otherwise</i>. It is natural that Proper nouns, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
there is no connection or only a fanciful one between
the word and its meaning, should be more liable to
such transformations than others; so the <i>Rose des
quatre saisons</i> appears as the <i>quarter-sessions rose</i>, the
<i>asparagus</i> appears as <i>sparrow grass</i>, the ship <i>Bellerophon</i>
becomes the <i>Billy ruffan</i>,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> the <i>Pteroessa</i>, the
<i>tearing hisser</i>. We may perhaps add here a word
like <i>liquorice</i>, which, though the name, rightly understood,
is descriptive, has become a mere proper noun.
Originally from <i>liquiritia</i>, itself a corrupt form of
<i>glykyrrhiza</i> = ‘a sweet root,’ it has, as its spelling
shows, become connected with <i>liquor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> while those
who deemed this impossible preferred to explain the
word as connected with <i>to lick</i>.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>II. Important, then, as the part played by phonetic
development is in bringing about the formation of new
material-groups, it has made its influence felt more
widely still in the modal grouping of the various
systems of inflection.</p>

<p>Here, again, two cases should be distinguished:
(1) when forms which have had identical functions
come to coincide: (2) when such coincidence occurs
in the case of forms that have had different functions.</p>

<p>1. The cancelling of diversities in form or in inflection
when such inflection indicated no difference in function
must obviously on the whole be set down as a gain to
language: simplicity is gained thereby without any
loss in clearness. This gain, however, is only effected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
when the abolition is complete; should the abolition
be partial only, simplification may be gained at the
expense of a new confusion.</p>

<p>We have an example of such a complete process of
cancelling in the terminations <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> in the comparative
and superlative of adjectives. In Gothic the
comparative was formed either with the suffix <i>iz</i> or <i>ôz</i>,
the superlative with <i>ist</i> or with <i>ōst</i>; and, except, indeed,
that the forms in <i>iz</i> and <i>ist</i> were more common than
those in <i>ôz</i> and <i>ôst</i>, and that the latter are found only
with stems in <i>a</i>, no rule can be given for their occurrence.
Thus <i>mānags</i> (an <i>a</i> stem) has in its comparative
<i>managiz-a</i>, superlative <i>managists</i>; <i>alðeis</i> (<i>ja</i> stem)
<i>alðiza</i>, <i>alðists</i>; <i>hardus</i> (<i>u</i> stem), <i>hardiza</i>, <i>hardists</i>; but
<i>frôðs</i>, <i>frôdôza</i>, <i>frôdôsts</i>; <i>arms</i>, <i>armôza</i>, <i>armôsts</i>.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> In
Old High German there was a similar uncertainty.
Here the <i>z</i> of Gothic appeared as <i>r</i> in the comparatives,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
and while <i>salîg</i> has for its comparative <i>salîgôro</i> and its
superlative <i>salîgôsto</i>, we find <i>(h)reini</i>, <i>(h)reiniro</i>, <i>(h)reinisto</i>.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
In Anglo-Saxon we find already but a single
termination for the comparative, viz. <i>ra</i>; but the two
forms of superlative are still extant in <i>ost</i> and <i>est</i>; <i>earm</i>,
<i>earmra</i>, <i>earmost</i>; <i>heard</i>, <i>heardra</i>, <i>heardost</i>; but <i>eald</i>,
<i>ieldra</i> (with <i>umlaut</i> or modified vowel),<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> <i>ieldest</i>. Our
forms <i>hard</i>, <i>harder</i>, <i>hardest</i>; <i>old</i>, <i>older</i>, <i>oldest</i>; <i>silly</i>,
<i>sillier</i>, <i>silliest</i>, etc., are clearly a further step in the right
direction of simplicity in system.</p>

<p>The convergence is, however, not always complete:
sometimes it happens that two systems coincide; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
this coincidence may be (1) in <small>ALL FORMS</small> but only in
<small>SOME WORDS</small> belonging to each system; or, again, (2) it
may manifest itself in <small>ALL WORDS</small> but only in <small>SOME
FORMS</small>; and, lastly, this coincidence may affect (3) only
<small>SOME WORDS</small> in <small>SOME FORMS</small> of two converging systems.</p>

<p>In the case of (1) the convergence is complete and
irrevocable, and words which formerly belonged to one
system have simply parted company with it, and have
definitely joined the other to which they were assimilated.
In the cases, however, of (2) and (3), confusion
must arise, and further development must be looked
for. We find a good illustration of this confusion and
of its development in the history of the Teutonic
declensions. In the case of these, as of other Indo-European
languages, the declensions differed as the
stems of the words terminated in a consonant or a
vowel; and amongst the latter, again, we must draw
distinctions between the declension of stems in <i>a</i>, (<i>o</i>), <i>i</i>,
and <i>u</i>. In the <i>a</i> declension, again, a subdivision arose
for <i>pure a</i>, <i>ja</i>, <i>wa</i>, and <i>long ā</i> stems. These different
terminations of the stems are, for instance, clearly preserved
in Gothic dat. and acc. plur. <i>dags</i>, <i>dagam</i>,
<i>dagans</i>; <i>gasts</i>, <i>gastim</i>, <i>gastins</i>; <i>sunus</i>, <i>sunum</i>, <i>sununs</i>;
and (with Gothic <i>ō</i> instead of <i>ā</i>) <i>gibā</i>, <i>gibōm</i>, <i>gibōs</i>.
In the oldest forms of Scandinavian, the so-called
Ur-Norse, also, we find the vowels preserved in the
nominative singular, <i>holingar</i>, <i>erilar</i>, etc., <i>gastir</i>, <i>staldir</i>,
etc., <i>haukoður</i>, <i>warur</i>:<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> but even in these, the oldest
forms of the Teutonic dialects accessible to us, the
various systems were confused; and it is the study of
Comparative Grammar that we have to thank for the
distinction between the different classes; and, again, it
is only owing to the light shed on the subject by the
comparison with Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit cognates,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
that we are enabled in some instances to decide to which
of these classes any given word belongs. The ‘wearing
down’ of the various terminations produced here
identity, elsewhere close resemblance of many cases in
many words, while in other cases the influence of the
preceding letter made itself felt, and a difference in
declension arose for the <i>a</i> stems: this difference depending
on whether the <i>a</i> was preceded by a consonant
<i>i</i> (<i>j</i>) or <i>w</i>. Where phonetic development had
caused some of the cases to agree, other cases soon
followed suit, and thus we find, for instance, that even
in Gothic the entire singular of <i>i</i> declension has already
become identical with that of the <i>a</i> <span class="nowrap">stems:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As a consequence of this, numerous words which
cognate languages prove to belong to the <i>i</i> declension
are nevertheless entirely declined like <i>a</i> stems in
Gothic; and even in the very few Gothic texts which
we possess, and though these are derived from one
source only, we meet with words evidencing the fact
that Ulfilas himself (or, it may be, his copyist) was
sometimes confused as to the declension usually
followed by some word in his own language. Thus,
in case of <i>wêgs</i> (a wave), we find norm plur. <i>wêgôs</i>, but
dat. plur. <i>wêgim</i>; so too, the dat. plur. of <i>aiws</i> is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
<i>aiwam</i>, while the accus. is <i>aiwins</i>. In Old High
German the coincidence in termination between these
two schemes goes further, and extends over <i>all cases</i>;
but since&mdash;in such words as had <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, or <i>u</i>, in the preceding
syllable&mdash;<i>umlaut</i> had been produced in the
plural by the <i>i</i> of the stem, only those words whose
stem vowel would not admit of <i>umlaut</i> or <i>modification</i>
became throughout identical with the <i>a</i> declension.
Where the reverse was the case, the words naturally
remained distinct in the plural, and a further development
arose; viz. that this <i>umlaut</i> in the plural began
to be regarded as a sign of that number, and to be
used for the purpose of marking it even in words
whose etymology afforded no justification for the
change, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>hand</i>, <i>hände</i>, which word originally
belonged to the <i>u</i> declension. See also our remarks
in Chapter V. pp. 87 and foll.</p>

<p>2. So far, in every case which we have discussed,
we have had to do with similarity arising from phonetic
development of forms with identical functions:
one or more cases of one system <i>converged</i> with the
same cases in another system. Often, however, this
same phonetic development creates a similarity between
forms which were originally distinct and served distinct
purposes; and we have a good instance of this
in our personal pronouns, and one which is instructive
as to the consequences of this <span class="nowrap">phenomenon:&mdash;</span>

we see (though separate forms for accusative still
occur) that dative and accusative have become identical

The double form of the nominative <i>ye</i> (<i>you</i>), and more
especially the history of the pronoun for the third
person, illustrate one of the consequences of such coincidence,
viz. that the language-producing community
becomes accustomed to use the same form for certain
sets of functions, and transfers this similarity to cases
which it would not reach&mdash;or, at least, has not yet
reached&mdash;by the aid of phonetic development alone.
Let us consider first the pronoun of the third person.
In Anglo-Saxon we <span class="nowrap">find&mdash;</span>

<span class="tcell"><i>hit</i>.</span>
</span></span>

The forms which we now use for the plural are derived
from a different stem,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> which in Anglo-Saxon gave us
the following plural for all three <span class="nowrap">genders:&mdash;</span>

<span class="tcell"><i>ðá</i></span>

<span class="tcell"><i>ðá</i></span>
</span></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and here we find distinct forms for dative and accusative,
the latter of which has now disappeared, so that
here, too (as in the case of the other personal pronouns),
we use one form only (the original dative form)
for both dative and accusative. But we have only
reached this stage after a period of confusion and
uncertainty, during which the historically correct form
of the accusative and the new form (that of the old
dative) strove for permanence.</p>

<p>It is the very marked difference between <i>ic</i> (<i>I</i>) and
<i>me</i> (accus.), <i>ðu</i> (<i>thou</i>) and <i>ðe</i>, <i>we</i> and <i>us</i>, which has
protected the members of these pairs from becoming
identical in form, notwithstanding the important fact
that such a process had long since identified the
nominative and accusative of all nouns and adjectives.
To this influence, indeed, <i>ye</i> and <i>you</i> (both of which,
when unemphatic, become <i>ye</i>, where <i>e</i> is pronounced as
in <i>the</i> before a consonant) have succumbed.</p>

<p>Not only in this way, moreover, does such convergence
of forms with different functions show its
effect: it also causes the ordinary speaker to lose sight
of such difference in function altogether. As students
of Latin, and especially teachers of that language,
know by sad experience, it is extremely hard for
the untrained English mind to realise the function of
the accusative case; and the difference between this
case and the dative may be fairly described as non-existent
for the Englishman who has not learnt it from
the study of other languages. This, again, influences
syntax, so that a phrase like <i>I showed him the room</i> can
be turned in the passive into <i>The room was shown (to)
him</i>, etc., or <i>He was shown the room</i>, etc.

<span class="medium">ON THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGE IN FUNCTION ON
ANALOGICAL FORMATION.</span></h2>

<p>The careful consideration of such a form as <i>I breakfasted</i>
will lead us to understand another phase in the
life history of our words, and in the development of
their syntactical combinations. It is well known that
the word <i>(to) breakfast</i> is really a compound of the
verb <i>to break</i> and the noun <i>fast</i> (ieiunium). Accordingly,
we find, about the year 1400 <small>A.D.</small>, ‘Ete and be
merry, why <i>breke</i> yee nowt your <i>fast</i>;’ in 1653, Izaak
Walton wrote, ‘My purpose is to be at Hodsden
before I <i>break</i> my <i>fast</i>;’ and as late as 1808, Scott
writes in his Marmion, ‘and knight and squire had
<i>broke</i> their <i>fast</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> In these and similar cases, the
words have retained their full and original meaning of
‘to put an end to fasting by eating;’ and the natural
apprehension of this compound when employed as a
noun was in the sense of the meal whereby this
process is effected after the night’s fasting, <i>i.e.</i> the
first meal taken in the day. When once the verb had
thus acquired the meaning of ‘to take the first meal
in the day,’ and was next applied even in cases where
so little food had been taken before that meal as to
be hardly worth considering a ‘meal,’ the meaning of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
‘breaking the fast’ had been effaced by the new sense
of <i>eating the first</i> <small>IMPORTANT</small> <i>meal of the day</i>. The
change of meaning, coupled with the change in function,
disconnected the compound from the linguistic
groups to which it had hitherto belonged, and so
it came about that, after the analogy of other verbs
formed from nouns, <i>to breakfast</i> was conjugated as a
weak verb. Thus, in 1679, Everard writes, <i>After
breakfasting peaceably</i>; and about a century later, the
word is used transitively in the sense of ‘to entertain
at breakfast,’ e.g., <i>They will breakfast you</i>, or <i>I was
breakfasted</i>.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>This and all the following examples to be discussed
in this chapter illustrate the point that, in the unconscious
grouping of our words into material and modal
groups, it is mainly the function of the word which
causes such grouping; and that a change of function,
entailing, as it does, a change in the grouping, will
often expose the word which has thus altered its
meaning to the influence of analogy with other groups,
though as long as it preserved its original meaning it
stood quite apart from them. No doubt, however,
similarity of form conduces also sometimes to this end.
The group to which the word once belonged will then
follow its own path of development, while the detached
member will go on its new way.</p>

<p>We have a similar instance in <i>vouchsafe</i>: <i>The king
vouches it</i> <small>SAUE</small> (Robert of Brunne, early in fourteenth
century), where we should now say: <i>The king vouchsafes</i>.
The verb <i>to backbite</i> is most probably a
derivative from the compound nouns <i>back-biting</i> (of
which the earliest instance dates from 1175) and
<i>backbitter</i> (which is found as early as 1230); while in
the Early English Psalter (<small>A.D.</small> 1300) the past tense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
is still formed <i>bac-bate</i>. Gower (1393) already formed
the past participle <i>back bited</i>.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Again, the noun <i>browbeating</i>
(from ‘to beat one’s brows,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘to lower the
brows,’ ‘to frown’), found as early as 1581,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> became,
from a compound noun, a simple one with the meaning
of scolding or teasing; and gave rise to a verb <i>to
browbeat</i>, of which the earliest known instance dates
from 1603. It is, however, doubtful whether this verb
has hitherto been definitely separated from the group
to which etymologically speaking it belongs. The
past participle <i>brow-beat</i> (1803; Jane Porter, Thaddeus)
occurs, it is true, but the more usual form is as
yet <i>browbeaten</i>.</p>

<p>The most ordinary results of this process are, of
course, all the numerous formations from nouns that
have been pressed into the service of verbs; as, <i>I box</i>,
<i>He boxed</i>; <i>(to) dust</i>, <i>(to) soap</i>, <i>(to) dog</i>, etc., etc.: in the
case of all which, the change of function must have
preceded all forms due to analogy with the groups
into which the word entered solely in consequence of
that change. So, again, as long as a word has an
adjectival function, and even when it is used substantively,
but retains its original attributive meaning,
it is, in English, not declined: as <i>the</i> <small>POOR</small> <i>men</i>; <i>the</i>
<small>POOR</small> <i>ye have with you always</i>; <i>the</i> <small>BLUE</small> <i>hats</i>. When,
then, only certain individuals belonging to the class
designated by the adjective have to be indicated&mdash;and
not, as in the case of <i>the poor</i>,&mdash;all the individuals
possessing the quality of poverty,&mdash;we resort to the
addition of the word <i>ones</i>: as, <i>I do not like those green
hats; I prefer the blue</i> <small>ONES</small>. As soon, however, as
the word loses its real signification, and passes into a
proper noun, it is at once declined: as, <i>the Grays</i>, <i>the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
<i>Pettys</i>, <i>the Quicklys</i>; <i>the Blues</i>, <i>the Liberals</i>, <i>the
Conservatives</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>It may happen that the position of the accent aids
to produce change of function, as in the case of <i>prófecto</i>
(<i>pró facto</i>), and in the very interesting case of
<i>igitur</i>, which has been shown to be the enclitic form
of <i>agitur</i>, originating in the common Plautine phrase
(<i>Quḯd agitur</i>) <i>Quíd igitur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>The case is similar with the adverbial termination
<i>-ment</i> in French and <i>-mente</i> in Italian, from the Latin
<i>mente</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruellement</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crudeli mente</i>) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fièrement</i> are
intelligible formations; but <i>solidement</i>, <i>lourdement</i>, etc.,
are formed upon their analogy. At first applied only
to adverbs of manner, the termination was transferred
to adverbs of time and space; as, <i>anciennement</i>, <i>largement</i>.
Our English termination <i>-ly</i> (from <i>like</i>) is a
familiar instance of the same degradation of the final
syllable: cf. <i>godlike</i>, by the side of <i>godly</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>self</i> was originally an adjective meaning
in Anglo-Saxon and Middle-English ‘the same,’
and declined in apposition with the noun or personal
pronoun to which it was attached to mark emphasis.
It then stood in the same case, number, and gender,
<i>he selfe</i>, <i>his selfes</i>, <i>him selfum</i>, <i>hine selfne</i>, etc., gen.
and dat. sing. fem. <i>hyre selfre</i>, etc. The history of
the development from this usage to our present one
is not quite clear; but we should remember that the
terminations of the adjective were among the first to
wear off completely, or at least to become confused and
indistinct; and, further, that the accusative of the
personal pronouns, was at an early date merged into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
the dative. We thus obtain the following schematic

<p>Now, if we bear in mind that in these combinations
the accent fell upon the word <i>self</i> (or <i>selve</i>), and that
consequently the proclitic forms <i>my</i>, <i>me</i>, and <i>thy</i>, <i>thee</i>,
in the genitive and dative had the same sound
respectively,&mdash;and, further, that in the feminine of the
third person singular (<i>herself</i>), these two cases were
also alike,&mdash;it does not seem strange (1) that these two
cases (genitive and dative) became confused, and (2)
that the word <i>self</i> became a noun, as exemplified in
such phrases as <i>I said it to herself</i>. Once having
changed its function, the word assumed the flection
of the new group to which its new function had
attached it, and a plural form, as of a noun, arose&mdash;<i>themselves</i>,
<i>ourselves</i>, <i>theirselves</i>.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> When once a single
form served in three (genitive, dative, accusative) of
the four cases, it not unnaturally succeeded in ousting
the last, and succeeded all the more easily as <i>I self</i>
was, of course, wrong, if <i>self</i> was a noun.</p>

<p>It is not, however, an invariable rule that the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
associations into which a word enters in consequence
of its change of function entail a change of form in the
word. In Latin the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frugi</i> was originally the
dative case of a word <i>frux</i>, gen. <i>frugis</i>, meaning
<i>fruit</i>, <i>profit</i>, <i>advantage</i>; and is actually employed by
Plautus, with the full consciousness of its origin, in
the phrase <i>bonæ frugi esse</i> (Asin., III. iii. 12). In fact,
this use is exactly parallel to the use of <i>usui</i> in <i>bono
usui estis nulli</i>, in Plautus, Curculio, l. 499; but in
this case, <i>usui</i>, owing to its frequent occurrence,
preserved the memory of its origin fresh. Cicero,
however, treats <i>frugi</i> simply as an indeclinable
adjective: <i>Homines et satis fortes et satis plane frugi et
sobrii</i> (In Verrem, v. 27). Instances are also frequent
where a change in meaning brings about a change in
syntactical construction. Thus, for instance, in Latin
we find that the nominative <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quisque</i> is coupled with
the reflective pronoun in the plural almost in the
signification of <i>singulatim</i>.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> In Plautus we find
<i>præsente testibus</i> (Amphitruo, II. ii. 203), and, in
Afranius and Terence, <i>absente nobis</i> (Eunuchus, IV.
iii. 7); in these cases the participles approach the
characteristics of prepositions. A similar development
gave to the present participle <i>considering</i> its present
prepositional force. <i>Macte</i> is used similarly. <i>Age!</i> in
Latin is used as generally as <i>Come!</i> in English, irrespective
of the number of persons addressed; <i>cave</i> is
used in the same way. <i>Paucis</i> is used for ‘a little’ in
<i>ausculta paucis</i> (Terence, Andria, 536). <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hélas</i> is used
in French by women equally as by men; φέρε, ἰδού,
in Old Greek, are addressed to either one or many
persons indifferently. In the same way, in late Greek,
ὤφελον and ὤφελε were employed simply as conjunctions,
without any consideration of number or person,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the original construction having been Ὀλέσθαι ὤφελον
τῇδ’ ἡμέρᾳ = ‘Would that <i>I</i> had perished on that day!’
In English <i>albeit</i> is used simply as a conjunction, and
<i>may be</i>, in the sense of perhaps, is showing a tendency
to fuse into one word, as it is actually written in
American conversational language <i>mebbe</i>.</p>

<p>In German we find expressions like <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heb hinten
über sich das glas</i>, ‘Raise your glass high’ (Uhland,
Volkslieder) instead of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">über dich</i>. In the same way
we find in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suo loco</i>, etc.; and in Latin law
formulæ, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si sui juris sumus</i>, where we should expect
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si nostri juris sumus</i> (<i>i.e.</i> ‘If we stand in our own
rights’). In Old Norse a middle and passive is formed
by the aid of a reflective <i>-sik</i> (sese), which is, of
course, properly applicable to the third person only:
it appears later as <i>-st</i>; thus, <i>at kalla</i>, ‘to call;’ <i>at
kallast</i>, ‘to be called.’ In the same way, we have
in English the words <i>(to) bask</i> and <i>(to) busk</i>,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> where
the proper meaning of the termination has so completely
died out that it is possible to write <i>busk
ye</i>. The passive is similarly formed in the Slavonic
languages.</p>

<p>Again, change of meaning influences the construction
in the case of numerous verbs in Latin, which
are properly intransitive, but are used as transitives.
Such are <i>perire</i>,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> <i>deperire</i>; <i>demori</i>, used in the sense of
‘to be mortally enamoured of;’ <i>stupere</i>, ‘to marvel at;’
<i>ardere</i>, ‘to love with fire:’ the last-mentioned two
words approximate in sense to <i>mirari</i> and <i>amare</i>
respectively, and hence the instinct of language
employs them in the same government.</p>

<p>The verb <i>to doubt</i>, in the etymological signification
of hesitating between two beliefs, was, and is still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
constructed with <i>whether</i>. If, however, Spenser (Faëry
Queene) <span class="nowrap">says&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘That makes them doubt their wits be not their aine,’<br /></span>
</span></span>

it is because the word is employed in this case, as
indeed it frequently is in Shakespeare, in the sense of
‘to fear.’</p>

<p>The verb <i>to babble</i>, originally used intransitively,
means <i>to prattle</i> or <i>to chatter</i>. When, however, it is
employed in the sense of ‘to speak foolish words.’ or
of ‘to reveal by talking,’ it is used with an object in
the accusative case, and a passive is formed of it; e.g.,
<i>Griefs too sacred to be babbled to the world</i>. Again,
compound words, as long as they are felt as such by
the speakers, are naturally treated as such; cf. the
Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">respublica</i>, which, though we write it as a
single word, was declined in both its parts, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">respublica</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reipublicæ</i>, etc. But, when it had once become an
indivisible unit&mdash;when the form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">république</i> in French,
or the English word <i>republic</i>, was formed with its
various meanings, all closely resembling, but not
identical with, that of the original compound, the
word came to be treated after the analogy of other
nouns, and the same derivatives are formed from it
as from a simple form; cf. <i>republican</i>, etc. This fact
is, again, instanced by such forms as <i>high-spirited</i>
(high-spirit + ed, and not high + spirited), <i>gentleman-like</i>
(gentleman + like, not gentle + manlike), <i>good-natured</i>
(goodnature + ed, not good + natured).</p>

<p>Similarly, the Latin compound <i>i</i> (a demonstrative
pronoun) + <i>pse</i> was at first declined as <i>eumpse</i> (<i>e.g.</i>,
Plautus, Truc., I. ii. 64), <i>eampse</i>, <i>eopse</i>, <i>eapse</i>, etc., all
which forms are found in Plautus.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> When, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
the word came to be looked on as a simple word, it
was declined as such: <i>ipsum</i>, <i>ipsam</i>, <i>ipso</i>, <i>ipsa</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In German there are many instances of words
compounded with adverbs of place which are specially
instructive as to the way in which a word may become
detached from its previous use by a change of meaning.
For instance, in modern German the usage is to
say <i>wirken</i> <small>AUF</small> <i>etwas</i>, and not <small>IN</small> <i>etwas</i>, which was the
usage even in the last century. In the same way, we
speak of influence <i>over</i> as much as of influence <i>on</i>,
showing that we have forgotten the significance of <i>in</i>.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>The word <i>welcome</i> in such phrases as <i>I made them
welcome</i> is employed as an adjective, as, indeed, it is
commonly apprehended to be. It was originally a
substantive, and was derived from the infinitive mood
of the verb, its meaning being <i>pleasure-comer</i>. The
word is popularly supposed to derive from <i>well</i> and
<i>come</i>; but the first element in the compound is really
related to <i>will</i>&mdash;the true sense being the <i>will-comer</i>,
i.e. <i>he who comes to please another’s will</i>. (Cf. Ger.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkommen</i>.) The change in meaning seems due to
Scandinavian influence, for in the Scandinavian languages
the word is <i>really</i> composed of the adjective
<i>well</i> and the past participle <i>come</i>; cf. Danish <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">velkommen</i>
(welcome).<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>The expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quin conscendimus equos</i> (Livy, i.
57) is properly <i>Why do we not mount our horses?</i> but
is understood as <i>Let us mount our horses</i>; and in
accordance with such usage <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quin</i> may take after it an
imperative, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quin age</i>; or a hortative subjunctive, as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quin experiamur</i>? The sense of <i>cur</i> in some cases
approximates to that of <i>quod</i>; and hence we find the
word followed by a similar construction, in Horace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Ep. I. 8. 9;&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">irascar amicis, Cur me funesto properent
arcere veterno</i>. The O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">car</i> underwent a similar
change. Derived from <i>quare</i> it meant, in the first
instance, <i>then</i>; as, <i>Cumpainz Rolond, l’oliphant</i> <small>KAR</small> <i>sunez</i>
(Chanson de Roland), i.e. <i>Compagnon Roland sonnez</i>
<small>DONC</small> <i>l’oliphant</i>;<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> it next came to be used like <i>que</i> or
<i>parceque</i> after phrases like <i>la raison est</i>; and it then
comes to be used with the conditional and imperative
in the sense of <i>utinam</i> (<i>cf.</i> Diez, iii. 214).</p>

<p>In O.Fr. the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par</i> (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</i>) was used for
<i>much</i>. It took this sense from its use in combinations
like <i>perficere</i>, <i>perraro</i>, etc., but it was detached from
the verb, and was habitually used in O.Fr. in such
combinations as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par fut proz</i> = <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il fut très preux</i>;
and in some cases coupled with other adverbs, like
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moult</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant</i>; as, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant par fut bels</i> = <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il était si beau</i>,
literally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant beaucoup</i> (Chanson de Roland). The
phrase survives in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par trop</i>.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The Greek οὐκ οῦν, originally <i>not therefore</i>, like
the Latin <i>nonne</i>, serves to introduce a question expecting
an affirmative answer. It then comes to be used
to introduce direct positive assertions; thus, οὐκοῦν
ἐλευθερία ἡμᾶς μένει; from meaning ‘Does not, then,
freedom await us?’ comes to mean simply ‘Therefore
freedom awaits us.’ The word <i>nanu</i> in Sanskrit has
gone through a similar development. <i>Ne</i> in Latin,
properly the interrogative particle, comes to be used
as the correlative of <i>an</i>:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciatne an non faciat</i>; or
even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciat, necne</i>. Similarly, in Russian, the interrogative
particle <i>li</i> comes to be used as the correlative
of <i>ili</i> (or); as <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">ugodno-li vam eto?</i> (‘Is this agreeable
to you?’); but we then get combinations like <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">dyélaet-li,
ili ne dyélaet</i> (‘whether he does it or no’).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>The accusative with an infinitive could originally
only stand in connection with a transitive verb as long
as the accusative of the subject was regarded as the
object of the finite verb, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">audio te venire</i>; but the
accusative and infinitive came to be regarded as a
dependent sentence with the accusative as its subject,
and then we find the construction after words like
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaudeo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horreo</i> (Livy, xxxiv. 4. 3), <i>doleo</i> (Horace, Odes,
iv. 4. 62), etc., which can properly speaking take no
accusative of the object connected with them; as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaudere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infitias ire</i>; nay, we find it after combinations
such as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spem habeo</i>, etc. The accusative
and infinitive construction then passes into sentences
which depend on another accusative and infinitive, as
(1) into relative sentences loosely connected; e.g.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mundum censent regi numine Deorum&mdash;ex quo illud
natura consequi</i> (Cic. de Fin., iii. 19, § 64): (2) into
sentences of comparison; e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut feras quasdam nulla
mitescere arte sic immitem ejus viri animum esse</i> (Livy,
xxxiii. 45): (3) into indirect questions; e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid sese
inter pacatos facere, cur in Italiam non revehi</i> (Livy,
xxviii. 24);<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> (4) into temporal and causal sentences;
e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crimina vitanda esse, quia vitari metus non posse</i>
(Seneca, Epist., 97. 13). A similar extension of the
use is found in Greek.</p>

<p>The possessive cases <i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>,
<i>your</i>, <i>their</i> have passed into the category of adjectives,
as in the case of <i>Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?</i>
(1 Henry IV., III. iii. 93). The instinct of language
regarded <i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, etc., as the equivalents of <i>of me</i>,
<i>of thee</i>, etc.; and marked the function by the addition
of the possessive preposition <i>of</i>, as in <i>this inn of mine</i>.
Thus, again, a gerund like <i>killing</i>,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> from having the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
same form as the participle, can be used in expressions
like <i>the killing a man</i>, instead of <i>the killing of a man</i>.</p>

<p>We not only find that the word which changes its
function undergoes the consequent changes in form or
in syntax, but it also often happens that, owing to
functional changes participated in by a certain group
of words, such a group becomes detached, and thereby
gains independence enough to influence other words
that have cognate meanings. There are in Old
English, as in German, many adverbs which are in
their origin the genitives singular of strong masculine
and neuter substantives, such as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">dæges</i> (<i>by day</i>); but
the origin of the termination has been forgotten, and
the <i>s</i> has come to be looked upon as a merely adverbial
termination. Consequently we find the adverb <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nihtes</i> (<i>by
night</i>), though <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">niht</i> is really feminine, and its genitive
case is properly <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nihte</i>. Similar formations are <i>hereabouts</i>,
<i>inwards</i>, <i>othergates</i> (Shakespeare, Twelfth
Night, V. i. 198), <i>towards</i>, <i>whereabouts</i>, etc. In the
same way, the genitive plural of Anglo-Saxon substantives
in <i>-ung</i> (later <i>-ing</i>) could be used adverbially; as,&mdash;<i>án-ung-a</i>,
<i>án-ing-a</i>, (altogether), genitive plural of <i>ân-ung</i>,
a substantive formed from <i>án</i> (one): after this
analogy others were formed: as, <i>hedling</i>, afterwards
altered to <i>headlong</i>; <i>darkling</i>, etc.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="medium">DISPLACEMENT IN ETYMOLOGICAL GROUPING.</span></h2>

<p>We have already more than once had occasion to
point out that, in our individual vocabularies, two
classes of words are inextricably confused. In the first
place, we employ such words and derivatives of words
as we <small>REPRODUCE</small> by the aid of <small>MEMORY</small>, which recalls
to us what we have frequently heard from those with
whom we have intercourse. In the second place,
another part of our stock of words and verbal derivatives
is <small>FORMED</small> by us on the <small>MODEL OF OTHER FORMATIONS</small>
of the first class.</p>

<p>Only in a very few cases is it possible for any
speaker to decide, with absolute certainty, whether any
particular form which he may employ with perfect
familiarity belongs to the former or the latter group.
If, for instance, we hear the simple sentence, ‘He is
walking,’ there is nothing which can help us to determine
whether the speaker is merely reproducing the
word <i>walking</i> just as he has learnt it from others, or
whether he is forming the present participle of and
from the word ‘(to) walk’ after the model of other
similar derivatives. In the chapter on Analogy, we
considered principally cases falling under the second
class, in which the result of such a process as we have
described proved at variance with other forms already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
existing in the language, <i>i.e.</i> where <i>Analogy</i> brought
about certain changes. The cases in which the result
was the mere production of what we should have
reproduced by the simple aid of memory, we considered
as of very small importance for the purpose of illustrating
the operations of Analogy.</p>

<p>But it is far from true that they have no significance.
Every time that we consciously or unconsciously
form words ‘by analogy,’ our habit of doing
so is strengthened, and our confidence in the results
is increased; and the more we enter upon domains of
thought where we are comparative strangers, the more
confidently and the more consciously do we proceed
‘to make our own words.’ In this process of word-making,
we follow certain models; in fact, we derive
one form from others which exist in our own
vocabulary.</p>

<p>In words and forms reproduced by memory (though
only in the case of such as these) it is, strictly speaking,
correct to say of each form&mdash;tense, person, singular
or plural, or of each case&mdash;that it is derived, not from
what our grammars call the standard forms (such as
infinitives or nominative-singulars), but from the corresponding
older form of that tense, person, etc., in the
language as it existed before.</p>

<p>In words and forms produced, not from memory,
but by analogy, <i>i.e.</i> by derivation according to a certain
model, and from words which already exist in our
own vocabulary, even where our result does not differ
from what we might have produced by memory, it
does not at all follow that our process of derivation
has been the same as that by which former speakers
reached their results.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose that there exists a class of
adjectives really derived from verbs. In the course of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
development of the language, these verbs approach in
form to the cognate nouns, or&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;some
of the verbs become obsolete. The effect will
be that, in the consciousness of the ordinary speaker,
the adjective appears as derived from the noun.</p>

<p>It is our object in this chapter to study the phenomenon
of such displacements in the etymological
connections and the consequences which follow therefrom.</p>

<p>A good instance may be found in the history of the
suffixes <i>ble</i>, <i>able</i>, and their application.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Both these
suffixes we owe to the French language, which, in turn,
derived them from Latin.</p>

<p>In this latter language we find the suffix <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bili-s</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bilem</i>, forming verbal adjectives. Where the stem of
the verb ended in a consonant, the connecting vowel
<i>i</i> was inserted: <i>vend-e-re</i>, <i>vend-i-bilis</i>. Where the stem
ended in a vowel this insertion was of course unnecessary:
<i>honora-re</i>, <i>honora-bilis</i>, <i>dele-re</i>, <i>delebilis</i>, <i>(g)no-scere
no-bilis</i>, etc. By far the greater number of these
words in <i>ble</i> were derived from verbs in <i>are</i>, of
which the present participle ends in <i>ans</i>, <i>antem</i>.
Hence, though the words in <i>ble</i> were in reality not
immediately derived from this participle, a feeling arose
that such a connection existed. Among ‘the matter-groups’
in French their existed numerous pairs, such
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aimant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aimable</i>, etc. In time, all present participles
in French came to end in this termination <i>ant</i>, after
which an adjective in <i>able</i>, derived from such participles,
nearly always supplanted the older and correcter forms
in <i>ible</i>, etc. Hence came forms like <i>vendable</i>, <i>croyable</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>The suffix <i>able</i>, introduced into English in enormously
preponderating numbers, was there at first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
confined to words of French origin, but soon, by
analysis of such instances as <i>pass-able</i>, <i>agree-able</i>, <i>commend-able</i>,
was treated as an indivisible living suffix, and
freely employed to form analogous adjectives, being
attached not only to verbs taken from French, but
finally to native verbs as well, e.g., <i>bearable</i>, <i>speakable</i>,
<i>breakable</i>. These verbs have often a substantive of
the same form, as in <i>debat(e)-able</i>, <i>rat(e)-able</i>, etc. Owing
to this, a new displacement such as we are here studying
occurred, and such words, treated <i>as if</i> derived
<small>FROM THE NOUN</small>, became the models for others where
<i>able</i> is added to nouns, such as <i>marketable</i>, <i>clubbable</i>,
<i>carriageable</i>,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> <i>salable</i>.</p>

<p>Another suffix, the history of which affords an
instance of similar displacement is <i>ate</i> as verbal formative.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>We find in French several past participles, some
due to regular historical development of the popular
language, others to deliberate adoption by the learned
classes, all of which differ only from their Latin prototypes
in having lost the termination <i>us</i>: e.g., <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confusus</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confus</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contentus</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">content</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diversus</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">divers</i>. This
analogy was widely followed in later French in introducing
new words from Latin, and, both classes of
French words (<i>i.e.</i> the popular survivals and the later
accessions) being adopted in English provided English
in its turn with analogies for adapting similar words
directly from Latin by dropping the termination. This
process began about 1400 <small>A.D.</small>, and the Latin termination
<i>atus</i> gave English <i>at</i>, subsequently <i>ate</i>, e.g.
<i>desolatus</i>, <i>desolat</i>, <i>desolate</i>. The transition of these
words from adjectives and participles to verbs is explained
by Dr. Murray by a reference to the fact&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That in Old English verbs had been regularly
formed from adjectives: as, <i>hwit</i>, <i>hwitian</i> (‘white,’ ‘to
whiten’); <i>wearm</i>, <i>wearmian</i> (‘warm,’ ‘to warm,’); etc.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That with the loss of the inflections, these verbs
became by the fifteenth century identical in form with
the adjectives, e.g., <i>to white</i>, <i>to warm</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That, as in Latin, so in French, many verbs
were formed on adjectives; whence, again, English
received many verbs identical in form with their
adjectives, e.g., <i>to clear</i>, <i>to humble</i>, <i>to manifest</i>.</p>

<p>These verbs, though formed immediately from participial
adjectives already existing in English, answered
in form to the past participles of Latin verbs of the
same meaning. It was thus natural to associate them
directly with these Latin verbs, and to view them as
their regular English representatives. This once
done, it became the recognised method of Englishing a
Latin verb, to take the past participle stem of the
Latin as the present stem of the English, so that
English verbs were now formed on Latin past participles
by mere analogy and without intervention of a
participial adjective; e.g., <i>fascinate</i>, <i>concatenate</i>, etc.
These English verbs in <i>ate</i> correspond generally to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
French verbs in <i>er</i>,&mdash;e.g., <i>separate</i>, Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séparer</i>; this, in
turn, gave a pattern for the formation of English verbs
from French,&mdash;e.g., <i>isoler</i> (Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">isolare</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insulare</i>),
Eng. <i>isolate</i>, etc.</p>

<p>To this lucid and apparently adequate explanation
we must, however, add another fact, which has demonstrably
aided in the formation of the enormous number
of English verbs in <i>ate</i>. From the fourteenth century
onward, we find again and again such pairs as <i>action</i>
(1330), <i>to act</i> (1384);<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> <i>affliction</i> (1303), <i>to afflict</i> (1393);
<i>adjection</i> (1374), <i>to adject</i> (1432); <i>abjection</i> (1410), <i>to
abject</i> (1430), etc.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Such pairs led to the supposition that the verbs
were derivable from the nouns in <i>tion</i> by merely omitting
the <i>ion</i>, and this was done with many nouns in
<i>ation</i> even where another verb (itself the ground-word
for that form in <i>ation</i>) existed by the side of it. Thus
we find, e.g., <i>aspiration</i> (1398), <i>to aspire</i> (1460), the
verb <i>aspirate</i> (1700); <i>attestation</i> (1547), <i>to attest</i> (1596),
<i>to attestate</i> (1625); <i>application</i> (1493), <i>to apply</i> (1374),
<i>to applicate</i> (1531).<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>The suffix <i>full</i> forms adjectives from nouns: <i>baleful</i>,
A.S. <i>bealofull</i> from <i>bealu</i> (woe, harm, mischief); <i>shameful</i>,
A.S. <i>sceamfull</i> from <i>sceam</i> (shame). This ending
was also added to nouns of Romance origin; e.g., <i>powerful</i>,
<i>fruitful</i>. In both classes, however, the word might,
in very many cases, be just as well derived from a verb
as from a noun, so that, e.g., <i>thankful</i>, which originally
undoubtedly was = <i>full of thanks</i>, could equally well be
apprehended as <i>he who thanks</i>; <i>respectful</i>, as <i>he who
respects</i>; etc. It is similar with such words as <i>harmful</i>,
<i>delightful</i>, etc. That such a grouping has actually
been made, is proved by the occurrence of such forms
as <i>wakeful</i>, <i>forgetful</i>, and the dialectical <i>urgeful</i>; so
also the form <i>weariful</i> seems more likely to be interpreted
as <i>that which wearies</i>, than as a derivative from
the adjective <i>weary</i> as Mätzner seems to take it.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> So,
again, the form <i>maisterful</i>, found in Lydgate and
Chaucer,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> seems more likely to be taken as ‘he who is
always mastering,’ than ‘as he who is full of master,’
which gives no sense. The suffix <i>less</i>, originally and
still as a rule only added to nouns, could not have been
used with the verb to <i>daunt</i> (&mdash;O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danter</i>, Modern
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dompter</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">domitare</i>, ‘to tame,’) if in such
compounds as <i>restless</i>, <i>sleepless</i>, <i>hopeless</i>, <i>useless</i>, the
noun had not been identical in form with the verb.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>The history of the suffix <i>ness</i>, is also especially
instructive for our purpose. If we go back to the
oldest records of the Teutonic languages, Gothic, we
find a noun, <i>ufarassus</i>, literally ‘overness,’ used in the
sense of ‘abundance,’ ‘superfluity,’ from <i>ufar</i>, ‘over:’
similarly formed was <i>ibnassus</i>, ‘equality,’ from <i>ibns</i>&mdash;‘even,’
‘equal.’ This suffix <i>assus</i> was very frequently
added to the <i>stem of verbs</i> which, in their turn, were
derived from nouns. Thus, for instance, besides the
<span class="nowrap">noun&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>lekeis</i> (leach),</span>
<span class="tcell">we find</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>lekinon</i> (to cure),</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>lekinassus</i> (leachdom).</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>shalks</i> (servant),</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>shalkinon</i> (to serve),</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>shalkinassus</i> (service).</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>gudja</i> (priest),</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>gudjinon</i> (to be priest),</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>gudjinassus</i> (priesthood).</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>frauja</i> (Lord),</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>fraujinon</i> (to rule),</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>fraujinassus</i> (dominion).</span>
</span>
<span class="trow">
<span class="tcell"><i>ðiudans</i> (king),</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">”</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>ðiudanon</i> (to be king),</span>
<span class="tcell"><i>ðiudinassus</i> (kingdom).</span>
</span></p>

<p>In all these and similar cases, however, etymological
consciousness might equally well operate
otherwise. It might, for instance, derive a noun
meaning <i>kingdom</i> from another noun denoting <i>king</i>,
or one meaning <i>priesthood</i> from one denoting <i>priest</i>.
That this has been done is proved by the fact that
the <i>n</i> has coalesced completely with the suffix <i>assus</i>,
forming <i>nassus</i>, or, in its more modern form, <i>ness</i>.
Even in Gothic, this coalescence has already been
powerful enough to produce <i>vaninassus</i> (want) from
<i>vans</i> (adjective = ‘wanting,’ ‘less;’ found, <i>e.g.</i>, in
<i>wanhope</i> = ‘lack of hope,’ ‘despair:’ <i>wanton</i>, = ‘uneducated,’
‘untrained,’ ‘unrestricted,’ ‘licentious:’ and
<i>wane</i> = ‘to grow less’).</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon, adverbs were formed from
adjectives by means of the termination <i>e</i>: for instance,
<i>heard</i>, <i>hearde</i>, (‘hard’) ; <i>sóð</i>, <i>sóðe</i>, (‘true,’ cf. <i>soothsayer</i>
and <i>forsooth</i>); <i>wíd</i>, <i>wíde</i>, (wide). Adjectives in <i>lic</i>
were formed first from nouns: <i>eorð</i>, <i>eorðlic</i>, (‘earth,’
‘earthy’); <i>gást</i>, <i>gastlic</i>, (‘ghost,’ ‘ghostly’), etc.; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
then, also, from other adjectives, as <i>heard-heardlic</i>,
<i>æðele-æðelic</i>, (for æðel-lic), etc.</p>

<p>By the side of these adjectives, we naturally find
adverbs in <i>lice</i>, normally formed from them by the
addition of <i>e</i>; as, <i>æðelice</i>, etc.; but as soon as, owing to
phonetic decay of the terminations, the adjectives and
adverbs in both sets of words (both in those with and
without <i>lic</i>) came respectively to coincide,&mdash;when, for
instance, <i>heard</i> and <i>hearde</i> had both become <i>hard</i>, and
adjectives in <i>lic</i> and adverbs in <i>lice</i> had both come to
terminate in <i>ly</i>,&mdash;then the adjective that had never
ended in <i>lic</i> came also to be grouped with the adverb
in <i>lice</i>, or rather <i>ly</i>, and <i>ly</i> became the special and
normal adverbial termination: as in <i>prettily</i>, <i>carelessly</i>,
etc. Thus were produced a great quantity of
adverbs, the adjectives corresponding to which never
had the termination <i>ly</i>.</p>

<p>Modern English possesses remnants of all the
above original formations; as, for instance, the adverbs
(with loss of adverbial <i>e</i>) <i>hard</i>, in ‘to hit hard,’ <i>loud</i>,
in ‘to speak loud,’ etc.; or, again, the adjectives
<i>heavenly</i>, <i>earthly</i>, <i>kingly</i>, <i>goodly</i>, etc.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="medium">ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MEANING.</span></h2>

<p>Language develops by the development of the vocabulary
of individual speakers in the same linguistic
community: their tendency is to produce synonymous
forms and constructions in addition to those already
at their disposal. Each individual is, in fact, constantly
engaged in increasing the number of synonymous
words, forms, and constructions in the language
which he speaks. One source of this superfluous
development depends on analogical formation: as
when in English the imperfect is assimilated to the
participle, or the participle to the imperfect; as where
forms like <i>spoke</i> and <i>broke</i> appear beside <i>spake</i> and
<i>brake</i> or <i>held</i>, beside <i>holden</i>.</p>

<p>A second source of the same superfluity depending
on synonyms arises from the fact that of two
words, each may develop its meaning on its own lines,
and the meanings may come to converge so as to
become one and the same. Thus, for instance, the
two words <i>relation</i> and <i>relative</i>, the former originally
the abstract verbal noun, the latter an adjective, have
converged in the meaning ‘a related person;’ and it
has thus happened that owing to this process there
arise two terms for one and the same idea. To the
above a third source may be added; viz., the acceptance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of a foreign word into a language where a native
word already exists to express the same idea. Of
course English is especially rich in words of this kind,
owing to the large number of Norman-French words
imported at the Conquest and maintained as an integral
part of the language; though the process of
borrowing from French has been also active since the
epoch of the Conquest: such are the pairs <i>nude</i>, <i>naked</i>;
<i>pedagogue</i>, <i>schoolmaster</i>; <i>poignant</i>, <i>sharp</i>; <i>peccant</i>, <i>sinning</i>;
<i>sign</i>, <i>token</i>: other familiar instances are <i>tether</i>,
derived from the Celtic at an old date; and <i>loot</i>,
adopted from the Hindi, by the side of <i>plunder</i>. The
case is, of course, similar where a synonym is adopted
from another dialect, as <i>vetch</i> by the side of <i>fitch</i>, <i>vat</i>
beside <i>fat</i> (a vessel), etc.</p>

<p>But though such superfluities in language are continually
appearing, they have a constant tendency to
disappear on the earliest possible occasion. Language
is a careful housewife, who is constantly endeavouring
to keep nothing on hand but what she can use, and
carefully to retrench the superfluous. We must, of
course, never suppose that any body of speakers combine
to admit a word into the common language which
they employ, and that then, finding that the word or
form has its meaning already expressed in their
language and is therefore unnecessary, they proceed
to discard it. These new words and forms proceed in
each instance from individuals, who overlook the existence
in their own language of a term already in use
for some meaning which they need to express, and so
introduce a new form: this is then employed by others,
who, hearing the new form and the old, employ both
alike indiscriminately. Superfluity in language, then,
must be regarded as spontaneously arising, and without
the aid of any voluntary impulse on the part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of any individual or individuals. The language of
common life is, as might be expected, most ready in
freeing the vehicle of ordinary communication from
superfluities, and in the differentiation of synonyms.
The language of poetry and, in a less degree, of
written prose, demands a store of synonyms, on which
an author may draw at will, thereby forming an individual
style and avoiding monotony. It is as useful,
nay, as indispensable to the poet that he should
have a store of words with similar meanings which he
may employ for the purposes of his artificial style,
as it is for the ordinary speaker or writer to have a
distinct shade of meaning attached to each of the
synonyms which he employs. And as poetry makes
greater demands upon the taste and powers of an
author than prose, we find that the language of poetry
preserves archaic forms and words which in prose
have been practically obsolete. In fact such words
become the stock in trade of all writers of poetry,
appearing, of course, most frequently in those who
seek to invest their work with a peculiarly archaic
caste. Thus, the diction of Spenser must have appeared
almost as archaic to his contemporaries as to
ourselves.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Poetry will also maintain constructions
which have a tendency in prose to become obsolete:
as, <i>meseems; Time prove the rest</i>. The metaphors employed
in old Norse poetry are very instructive on
this head. They have been treated at great length
in the ‘Corpus Poeticum Boreale’ by Vigfusson and
York Powell, from whose work<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> we cite the following
instances. The breast is spoken of as <i>the mind’s</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
<i>house</i>, <i>memory’s sanctuary</i>, <i>the lurking-place of thought</i>,
<i>the shore of the mind</i>, <i>the bark of laughter</i>, <i>the hall
of the heart</i>. The eye is <i>the moon or star of the brows</i>,
<i>the light or levin of the forehead</i>, <i>the cauldron of tears</i>, <i>the
pledge of Woden</i>. Herrings are <i>the arrows of the sea</i>,
<i>the darts</i>, <i>the tail-barbed arrows of the deep</i>. Ships are
characterised by a host of metaphors; as, <i>the tree or
beam</i>, <i>the sled</i>, <i>the car</i>, <i>the beam or timber of the sea or
waves</i>; <i>the steeds of the helm, oars, mast, sail, yard</i>: and
numerous other specimens of ‘pars pro toto.’</p>

<p>The most simple and obvious case of retrenchment
in language is where, out of several similar forms and
phrases, all disappear and are disused except a single
one; as where <i>to grow</i> is used instead of <i>to wax</i>; <i>to go</i>,
instead of <i>to fare</i>, etc. We must look upon these
retrenchments in language as mainly due to individuals;
each speaker expresses himself more or less
unconsciously with a certain consistency, and uses,
generally speaking, what we may properly call his own
dialect. It is owing to such individual influence that
the distinctions in language which we call dialects
arise, and thus the different opportunities for choice
form a main source of the distinctions of dialect.</p>

<p>In addition to this negative process of simply
dropping what is useless, there is the positive process
of utilising what is superfluous in language by differentiation
of meaning in the case of synonymous words
and phrases. This process is no more the result of
conscious purpose than the other. Since each individual
has gradually to learn the different senses of
words, inflections, particles, etc., it is clear that when
there are several synonyms in use&mdash;each of which has
several shades of signification&mdash;he will almost certainly
hear one of them used in one, and another in another
of these meanings. If, for instance, we represent the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
full meaning of a word in its different shades by the
letters <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> + <i>C</i> + <i>D</i>, and, similarly, that of its
synonym by <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i> + <i>d</i>, the probability almost
amounts to certainty that when a learner first hears
the former word, the shade of meaning (say <i>B</i>) in
which it happens to be employed will differ from that
(say <i>d</i>) in which he first learns the use of the latter.
He will then inevitably, though perhaps unconsciously,
attach by preference these particular shades of meaning
to the two words; and will continue to do so,
unless stronger impulses, such as frequent use in other
meanings by surrounding speakers, force him to discard
the differentiation which he has established. But
from the moment when he begins to use, and as long
as he uses the word consistently in one sense, he will
influence others in the same linguistic community, and
lay the basis for definite acceptance of the word in a
particular or special sense.</p>

<p>Nor, again, must we assume that a differentiation
in sound was purposely and consciously made by
speakers with a view to differentiate meanings. Cases
taken from modern languages may serve to show the
unreasonableness of such assumptions. Especial attention
has been paid by writers on Romance Philology
to the ‘doublets’ occurring in their own languages.
By ‘doublets’ we mean the double derivative forms of
one and the same word (such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison</i>, ‘reason,’ and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ration</i>, ‘allowance,’ both coming from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rationem</i>): forms
commonly appearing in a language at two different
periods in the history of the language, and invested,
in spite of their common origin, with distinct and
special senses. The name of ‘doublets’ was first
applied to them by Nicolas Catherinot, who, as early
as 1683, published a list of those which he had observed
in French, but without giving the reasons for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the phenomenon. How imperfect the philological
knowledge of his day was may be seen from the
following specimens of ‘doublets’ which he gives:
from <small lang="it" xml:lang="it">BATTUERE</small>, Low Latin for ‘to fight,’ he derived
both <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battre</i> (to fight) and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuer</i> (to kill): from <small lang="it" xml:lang="it">GRAVIS</small>
(heavy), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grave</i>, serious; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brave</i>, brave: from <small lang="it" xml:lang="it">MARMOR</small>
(marble), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marble</i>, marble; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmot</i>, guinea-pig.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> A.
Brachet has collected many other specimens in the
work cited below: Coelho has made a collection from
the Portuguese in the Romania, II. 281, sqq.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>It must, however, be noticed that many of the
doublets cited in these works stand outside of the
class of those with which we have to deal, and such
cannot be taken as real cases of differentiation. For
instance, a loan word may immediately upon its introduction
have been accepted in a sense different from
that borne by the word of the same origin which
already existed in the language: as in the case of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chantée</i> (sung, fem. past part.) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cantata</i> (cantata, a
piece which is sung, as distinguished from a sonata, a
piece which is sounded or played), borrowed from the
Italian by the French; of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sexte</i> (term in music and
‘the sixth book’) with its doublet <i>sieste</i> (the hour of
rest) borrowed from the Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>, both derived
from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sextam</i>; of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façon</i> (manner) with its
doublet <i>fashion</i>, borrowed from the English, both from
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factionem</i>, ‘a making.’ Thus, again, the French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
<i>chose</i> (a thing) and <i>cause</i> (a cause) alike owe their
origin to the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causam</i>, but the meanings were not
differentiated in France: <i>cause</i> was borrowed as a law-term
long after <i>chose</i> had developed into the general
meaning of <i>thing</i>. It is the same, moreover, with
such English doublets as <i>ticket</i>, <i>etiquette</i>: <i>army</i>,
<i>armada</i>: <i>orison</i>, <i>oration</i>: <i>penance</i>, <i>penitence</i>. Such
doublets as these, and <i>guitar</i>, <i>zither</i>, <i>cithara</i> may be
called pseudo-doublets, producing as they do the <i>effect</i>
of differentiation, but serving really as labels to
designate a foreign idea or object. Nor, again, must
we include cases in which a word became grammatically
isolated and then received a special meaning; such as
where ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">besch<i>ei</i>den,</span>’ in German, is now employed with
the signification of ‘modest,’ while ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">besch<i>ie</i>den</span>’ is used
as the true participial form, and never means, or has
meant, ‘modest.’ Similarly, in French, we have
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> (a scholar) originally used as synonymous with
present participle <i>sachant</i> (knowing) but in modern
French as an adjective or noun only, whilst <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sachant</i>
has always remained present participle and no more:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amant</i>, the present participle of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amare</i> (to love) is used
as a substantive only.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>There are, however, other cases in which words
are really differentiated; that is to say, cases in which
two words, whose meaning we know to have been
identical, have come to be accepted in different
meanings. This is a genuine process of economy in
language. In French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s’attaquer à</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s’attacher à</i>
at one time were used with identically the same
meaning and employed indifferently. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attaquer</i> is
used in the sense of ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attacher</i>’ in this line of the fourteenth
century&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une riche escarboucle le mantel ataqua</i>
(‘a rich carbuncle attached (= held) the mantel’)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
(Bauduin de Sebourc, i. 370). On the other hand,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attacher</i> is used in the sense of ‘to attack:’ as in the
following passage, quoted by M. Brachet<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> from a letter
of Calvin to the regent of England,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tous ensemble
méritent bien d’estre réprimés par le glayve qui vous est
commis, veu qu’ils s’attaschent non seulement au roy, mais
à Dieu qui l’a assis au siège royal</i>, = ‘All together
deserve to be put down by the sword which has been
entrusted to you, seeing that they attack not merely
the King, but God who has set him on the royal seat.’
(Lettres de Calvin recueillies par M. Bonnet, ii. 201).
In modern French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attacher</i> is used exclusively in the
sense of ‘to attach’ ‘to fasten;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaquer</i> = ‘to attack.’
Another instance is found in <i>chaire</i> and <i>chaise</i>, both of
which words came into French from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cathedram</i>, and
both of which once signified the same thing (Theodore
Beza, in 1530, complains of the faulty pronunciation
of the Parisians who say <i>chaise</i> instead of <i>chaire</i>). At
the present day, of course, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaise</i> means ‘chair,’ and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaire</i> is confined to the signification of ‘pulpit’ or
‘professor’s chair.’ In English, <i>shoal</i> and <i>shallow</i> seem
to have been used synonymously, and to have become
differentiated.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Other instances are <i>of</i>, <i>off</i>; <i>naught</i>,
<i>not</i>; <i>assay</i>, <i>essay</i>; <i>upset</i>, <i>set up</i>; <i>Master</i>, <i>Mister</i> (<i>Mr.</i>);
<i>Miss</i>, <i>Mistress</i>, <i>Mrs.</i> (pronounced <i>Missus</i>). In these
cases, the differentiation took place within the given
language; and such cases should be carefully distinguished
from those cases in which the differentiation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
was made <i>outside</i> of the language. For instance, in
<i>squandered</i> and <i>scatter</i>, both of which seem to have
signified the same thing, simply ‘to disperse’; cf.,
<i>squandered abroad</i> (Merchant of Venice, I. iii. 22).
<i>Indict</i> and <i>indite</i> seem to have borne the same
meaning, but are now differentiated.</p>

<p>To these may be added the German doublets
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">reiter</i> (a rider) and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ritter</i> (a knight), which may be
paralleled by the use of the English <i>squire</i> and <i>esquire</i>;
of which the latter word has lately come into use
simply as a title of society, whereas both forms were
once used as in Scott’s <i>nine and twenty squires of fame</i>.
Other instances are <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheuen</i>, ‘to fear,’ and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheuchen</i>,
‘to scare:’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">jungfrau</i>, ‘maiden,’ and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">jungfer</i>, ‘virgin.’</p>

<p>Double forms arising from the confusion of
different methods of declension are often used in
different senses, as in the case of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus</i>,
whose plurals <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loca</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loci</i> mean ‘places,’ and
‘passages in books’ respectively: the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Franke</i>,
the Franconian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">franken</i>, ‘a franc’ (9½<i>d.</i>): this difference
is utilised, together with a difference of gender, in the
German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der lump</i>, ‘the worthless fellow;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die lumpe</i>,
‘the rag;’ etc. The difference of gender cannot be
utilised in English, but is thus utilised&mdash;in German&mdash;in
such cases as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DER</small> <i>band</i></span>, ‘volume;’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DAS</small> <i>band</i></span>, ‘ribbon:’
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DER</small> <i>see</i></span>, ‘the lake;’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DIE</small> <i>see</i></span>, ‘the sea:’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DIE</small> <i>erkenntniss</i></span>,
‘the act of judging;’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><small>DAS</small> <i>erkenntniss</i></span> ‘the judgment:’&mdash;in
French, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UN</small> <i>foudre de guerre</i></span>, ‘a thunderbolt
of war’ (personified); <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UNE</small> <i>foudre</i></span>, ‘a thunderbolt:’
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UN</small> <i>critique</i></span>, ‘a critic;’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UNE</small> <i>critique</i></span>, ‘a criticism:’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UN</small>

<i>paille</i></span>, ‘straw colour;’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>LA</small> <i>paille</i></span>, ‘the straw.’ To these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
must be added the cases in which double plural
formations are differentiated, as in English <i>clothes</i>,
<i>cloths</i>; <i>brothers</i>, <i>brethren</i>; <i>cows</i>, <i>kine</i> (poetical); <i>pence</i>,
<i>pennies</i>:&mdash;in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Band</i>, ‘bond’ and ‘ribbon;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bande</i>,
‘bonds:’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bänder</i>, ‘ribbons:’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bank</i>, ‘bench’ and ‘bank;’
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bänke</i>, ‘benches;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Banken</i>, ‘banks:’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesicht</i>, ‘face’
and ‘vision;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesichte</i>, ‘vision;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesichter</i>, ‘faces:’
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laden</i>, ‘shop’ and ‘shutter;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Läden</i>, ‘shops;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laden</i>,
‘shutters:’ etc.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> In French, we have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’aïeul</i>, ‘the
grandfather;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les aïeux</i>, ‘ancestors;’ and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aïeuls</i>, ‘grandfathers:’
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les travaux</i>, ‘works;’ and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les travails</i>, ‘a
minister’s reports:’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’œil</i>, ‘eye;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les yeux</i>, ‘eyes;’ and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les œils</i> (small oval windows commonly called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">œils de
bœuf</i>). The singular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appât</i> means ‘bait;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les appas</i>
signifies ‘charms,’ and has a doublet, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les appâts</i>,
meaning ‘baits.’ In Russian, the accusative plural is
the same as the nominative in the case of inanimate
objects: it is in the case of animate beings identical
with the genitive form. In Dutch, the plurals in <i>-en</i>
and <i>-s</i> are used in the case of some words indifferently,
as <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vogelen</i> and <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vogels</i>, ‘birds:’ in the case of some others,
one alone is commonly used, as <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">engelen</i>, ‘angels,’ but
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">pachters</i>, ‘farmers:’ again, in the case of others, both
forms are used, but with different meanings; thus
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hemelen</i>, ‘the heavens;’ but <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hemels</i>, ‘canopies of a
bed:’ <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">letteren</i>, ‘letters,’ or ‘literature;’ <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">letters</i>, ‘letters
of the alphabet;’ etc. From the Danish, we may
cite <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skatte</i>, ‘treasures;’ <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skatter</i>, ‘taxes;’ <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">vaaben</i>,
‘weapons;’ <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">vaabener</i>, ‘armorial bearings.’ From
Italian, we may instance <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">braccia</i>, ‘the two arms of the
body;’ <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bracci</i>, ‘arms of the sea;’ <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">membra</i>, ‘the
members of the body;’ <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">membri</i>, ‘the members of an
association.’ Similarly, in Spanish the neuter of the
second declension takes in many cases a feminine form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
in the plural; and in Portuguese this manner of
differentiation is more common than in any other
European language: cf. <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serra</i>, ‘saw,’ ‘mountain ridge;’
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">serro</i>, ‘a high mountain;’ etc. In Russian, <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">synovya</i>
means ‘descendants’; <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">synui</i>, ‘sons;’ etc. The words
<i>(to) purvey</i> and <i>(to) provide</i> have arisen from the same
original form, as have <i>respect</i> and <i>respite</i>; <i>deploy</i> and
<i>display</i>; <i>separate</i> and <i>sever</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>as</i>, like <i>also</i>, took its rise from the A.S.
<i>ealswâ</i>; it is simply a short form of <i>also</i>; and an intermediate
form exists in O.E. <i>alse</i> and <i>als</i>. In Maundeville,
p. 153, we find the two forms used convertibly:
<i>As foule as thei ben</i>, <i>als evele thei ben</i> = <i>so evil they
are</i>; and again, <i>als longe as here vitaylles lasten, thei
may abide there</i>, p. 130.</p>

<p><i>Than</i> and <i>thanne</i> were used in Chaucer’s time
where we should use <i>then</i>: <i>Now thanne, put thyn hond
down at my bak</i> (Chaucer, Cant. Tales, 7721); and in
comparisons <i>then</i> was used where we should employ
<i>than</i>, as: ‘I am greater <i>then</i> (i.e. <i>than</i>) you.’</p>

<p>In German, the word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verdorben</i> means ‘spoiled’ in
a material sense: <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verderbt</i> is employed in a moral sense
only. It is the same with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bewegt</i>, ‘moved,’ and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bewogen</i>,
‘induced.’ In English we employ <i>aged</i> mostly as a
participle proper, but <i>agèd</i> as an adjective; cf. also
<i>molten</i> and <i>melted</i>.</p>

<p>The words formed with the suffixes <i>-hood</i>, <i>-ness</i>, <i>-dom</i>
generally cover the same ground in English as in
Anglo-Saxon. There are, however, here also, a few
cases in which differentiation seems to have set in.
Such are <i>hardihood</i> and <i>hardiness</i>; <i>humble-hede</i>, <i>humble-ness</i>,
<i>humility</i>: <i>young-hede</i>, <i>youth</i>. In German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kleinheit</i>
and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">neuheit</i> were used convertibly with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kleinigkeit</i>
and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">neuigkeit</i>: now the former = <i>smallness</i>, <i>newness</i>, the
latter = <i>trifle</i>, <i>novelty</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>In the case of adjectives, we may see the same process
in <i>mobile</i>, <i>movable</i>: and in German, in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ernstlich</i>
and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ernsthaft</i> which were once used convertibly, but
are now differentiated.</p>

<p>Sometimes a word originally of a different meaning
encroaches on the domain of another word, and
gradually arrogates the latter’s meaning to itself. Thus,
in French, the meaning of <i>en</i>, the form taken in French
for the Latin <i>in</i>, has been encroached upon by the
preposition <i>à</i>, and by the adverb <i>dans</i> (O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denz</i> =
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de intus</i>), and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans</i> has completely ousted the prepositional
meaning of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dedans</i>. Molière could still write
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dedans ma poche</i> = ‘in my pocket.’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Böse</i>, in German, is
now almost restricted to the sense of ‘morally bad’ by
the encroachments of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlecht</i> (originally ‘smooth,’
‘straight’) English <i>slight</i>. The English word <i>sick</i>,
once the general word for <i>ill</i>, has been restricted in
meaning by the encroachments of the latter word.</p>

<p>Sometimes a newly formed word encroaches on the
domain of meaning covered by a word in existence, as
<i>to utilise</i> on <i>to use</i>; <i>serviceable</i> upon <i>useful</i>; <i>gentlemanly</i>
upon <i>genteel</i> and <i>gentle</i>; <i>magnificence</i> on <i>munificence</i>:<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
<i>mainly</i> is encroached upon by <i>chiefly</i>, <i>pursuer</i> by <i>persecutor</i>
and <i>prosecutor</i>: and sometimes it practically
ousts it from its previous meaning, as in the case of
<i>methodist</i>, <i>naturalist</i>, <i>purist</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The above examples may serve to show us some of
the main factors in the differentiation of meaning, and
with how little conscious design on the part of the
speakers they were carried out.

<span class="medium">CATEGORIES: PSYCHOLOGICAL AND GRAMMATICAL.</span></h2>

<p>The divisions into which grammarians have distributed
words, such as gender, number, and, in the case of
verbs, voice and tense, are based upon the function
which each word discharges in the sentence. Now,
these functional differences rest ultimately upon psychological
categories: that is to say, upon differences
which depend upon the view taken by our mind of the
natural grouping and classification of ideas. In other
words, the divisions formed by grammarians depend
ultimately upon the classification of the relations in
which the ideas suggested by words stand to each
other, as it appears to our imagination. Grammatical
classification was, in fact, originally nothing but an
attempt to express and group the order and connection
of ideas as they were conceived of by the human mind.
Immediately that this influence of imagination has
made itself felt in the usage of language, it becomes
a grammatical factor: and the groups which it forms
become grammatical categories. But the action of
the psychological category does not cease when it has
thus produced the grammatical; and the difference
between the two kinds is that, whereas the grammatical
categories become, so to speak, stereotyped and fixed,
those created by the imagination are ever changing;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
just as the human mind itself is ever changing its
ideas. Besides this, changes in sound-groups are always
occurring, and are constantly operating to prevent
the grammatical categories coinciding with the psychological.
Then, as a tendency makes itself felt to bring
about a coincidence of the two categories, the grammatical
category suffers a displacement, whence arise
what we are accustomed to call grammatical irregularities.
A consideration of the way in which these
irregularities arise may help us to understand the
origin of the grammatical categories, to which we now
proceed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gender.</span></h3>

<p>The foundation of grammatical gender is the
natural distinction between the sexes in mankind and
animals. Fancy may endow other objects or qualities
with sex; but sex, whether fanciful or real, has no
proper connection with grammar. The truth of this
may be well seen from the English language, in which
we have in most cases discarded the use of grammatical
gender. In order, therefore, to study the conditions
of gender, we have to turn to languages more highly
inflected than English.</p>

<p>The test whereby we now recognise the grammatical
gender of a substantive is the <i>concord</i> existing
between the substantive and its attribute and predicate,
or between it and a pronoun representing it&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus
nigra est</i>, ‘The house is black;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus quam vidi</i>, ‘The
house which I saw;’ <i>It is the moon; I ken her horn</i>
(Burns); etc. The rise, therefore, of grammatical
gender is closely connected with the appearance of a
variable adjective and pronoun. One theory to explain
this is, that the difference in form, before it yet marked
the gender, had become attached to a particular stem-ending:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
as if, <i>e.g.</i>, all stems ending in <i>n-</i> admitted the
ending <i>-us</i>&mdash;as <i>bonus</i>, ‘good,’&mdash;and all those in <i>g-</i> the
ending <i>-ra</i>&mdash;as <i>nigra</i>, ‘black;’&mdash;and that the ending
may have been an independent word which, while yet
independent, had acquired a reference to a male or
female.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Gender appears in English, in the first place,
as an artificial and often arbitrary personification, as
when the sun and moon are spoken of as <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>
respectively, under the influence of the ideas attaching
to Sol and Luna: Phœbus and Diana, etc.: and, again,
as an expression of interest in objects or animals, it
frequently occurs in the language of the people and of
children; though it sometimes enters into the language
of common life, as when a dog is referred to as <i>he</i> and
a cat as <i>she</i>, in cases where sex is not spoken of. (See
Storm, die lebende Sprache, p. 418.)</p>

<p>In the pronoun, as in the adjective, the distinction
of gender may appear in the stem-ending: as ‘un<i>e</i>’
(‘one,’ ‘a’); ‘qu<i>æ</i>,’ (‘which’). It may, however, also
be expressed by distinct roots, such as <i>er</i>, <i>sie</i>; <i>he</i> and
<i>she</i>. It is, indeed, probably in substantive pronouns
that grammatical gender was first developed, as in
fact it has longest maintained itself; as in English,
where, in adjectives and nouns, it has almost entirely
disappeared.</p>

<p>Grammatical gender probably corresponded originally
to natural sex. Exceptions to this rule must
gradually have come about, partly through changes of
meaning setting in,&mdash;as where a word is used metaphorically,
like <i>love</i> (neuter, abstract), <i>love</i> (masc. or
fem.&mdash;‘the beloved object’); or where it has
‘occasionally’ modified its meaning, like Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le guide</i>,
strictly ‘the guidance,’ and so used in Old French;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
<i>your fatherhoods</i> (Ben Jonson). Consequently we find
natural sex again influencing the genders as fixed by
grammar. Thus, in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die hässlichste meiner
kammermädchen</i> = ‘the ugliest of my chambermaids’
(Wieland), where the article <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die</i> is of the feminine
gender, though the word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kammermädchen</i>, being a
diminutive in <i>chen</i> is, like all others of that class,
neuter. In French, we have <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><small>UNE</small> (fem.) <i>brave enfant</i></span>,
‘a brave girl.’ The word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens</i>, again, is, properly
speaking, feminine, like the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la gent</i>, which still
survives in the restricted sense of ‘a race:’ but in
combinations like ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tous</i> les braves gens</span>’ (‘all worthy
people’) the grammatical gender is neglected; and
this neglect is fostered by the use of such a word as
<i>braves</i>, which in form might apply to either sex. On
the other hand, in combinations like ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les <i>bonnes</i> gens</span>,’
(‘good people’), where an adjective with a specifically
feminine termination is joined to the substantive, the
grammatical gender maintains itself. Cf., also, instances
like ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>un</i> enseigne</span>’ (‘an ensign’), ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>un</i> trompette</span>’ (‘a
trumpeter’); and, in Provençal, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>lo</i> poestat</span>,’ for ‘the
magistrate’ (‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>il</i> podestà</span>’). In Latin and Greek, these
so-called violations of the concord in gender are very
common; we are familiar with them as constructions
πρός σύνεσιν, i.e. <i>according to the sense</i>; cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thracum
auxilia</i> (neuter) ... <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæsi</i> (masc.) (Tac., Ann., iv.
48), ‘The Thracian auxiliaries were killed;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capita</i>
(neut.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conjurationis virgis cæsi</i> (masc.) <i>ac securi
percussi</i> (masc.) (Livy, x. 1), ‘The heads of the conspiracy
were slain and their heads cut off;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Septem
millia</i> (neut.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hominum in naves impositos</i> (masc.)
(Livy, xl. 41), ‘Seven thousand men put on board
ships;’ <i>Hi</i> (masc.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summo in fluctu pendent ... tres
Notus abreptas</i> (i.e. <i>naves</i>&mdash;fem.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in saxa latentia
torquet</i> (Vergil, Æn., i. 106-8), ‘Some (of the ships)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
hang on the crest of the waves ...; three, swept
away, the South wind whirls upon hidden rocks.’ In
Greek, ὦ φίλτατ’, ὦ περισσὰ τιμηθεὶς (masc.) τεκνον
(neut.) (Eur., Tro. 735), ‘O dearest, O much honoured
child;’ τὰ τέλη (neut.) καταβάντας (masc.) (Thuc., IV.
xv. 1), ‘The magistrates having descended:’ and
similar instances frequently in Thucydides.</p>

<p>We next find cases where the grammatical gender
has completely changed. Thus, in Greek, masculine
designations of persons and animals are turned into
feminines by simply referring them to female objects:
thus, we have either ὁ or ἡ ἄγγελος (‘messenger’),
διδάσκαλος (‘teacher’), ἰατρός, (‘healer’), τύραννος
(‘ruler’), ἔλαφος (‘deer’), ἵππος (‘horse’ or ‘mare’),
etc. In Christian times, a form ὁ παρθένος (‘an unmarried
man’) was constructed (Apocal., xiv. 4),
translated into Italian by <i>Vergine</i>. Neuter diminutives
in German readily become masculine or feminine
when the diminutive meaning has been obscured: as,
<i>e.g.</i>, the occasional construction <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Fräulein</i>, ‘the
young lady;’ cf., also, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Glycerium mea</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philematium mea</i> (Plaut., Most., I. iii. 96), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mea
Gymnasium</i> (Plaut., Cist., I. i. 2). In English, there
are a great number of words which would, in the first
instance, be thought of as masculines, as containing
a suffix commonly associated with masculine words.
These are, however, very frequently used as feminines;
and, in some cases, even when a feminine termination
exists side by side with the masculine one&mdash;as,
<i>She is heir of Naples</i> (Shakespeare, Tempest, II. i.):
others are <i>enemy</i>, <i>rival</i>, <i>novice</i>, <i>astronomer</i>, <i>beggar</i>,
<i>teacher</i>, <i>botanist</i>, etc. Cf. <i>she is a peasant</i> (Longfellow);
<i>The slave loves her master</i> (Lord Byron); <i>His only
heir a princess</i> (Temp., I. 2); <i>She is his only heir</i>
(Much Ado, I. i.); <i>The daughter and heir of Leonato</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
(ibid., I. iii.); <i>She alone is heir to both of us</i> (ibid.,
V. i.); etc.</p>

<p>If collectives or descriptions of qualities become
descriptions of persons, the result may be a change of
gender. The Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le garde</i> (‘the watchman’) was
once identical with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la garde</i> (‘the watch,’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigiliæ</i>);
cf. further, in Spanish, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el cura</i> (‘the priest’), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el justicia</i>
(‘the magistrate’): the Old Bulgarian <i lang="bg" xml:lang="bg">junota</i> (‘youth’),
as a masculine, means ‘a youth.’ The Russian <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Golova</i>
means ‘a head,’ and, in the masculine, ‘a conductor.’
Portuguese furnishes numerous instances of this; as,
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">a bolsa</i> (fem.), ‘the purse,’ ‘exchange;’ <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">o bolsa</i> (masc.),
‘the treasurer:’ <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">a corneta</i>, ‘the cornet;’ <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">o corneta</i>, ‘the
trumpeter:’ <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">a lingua</i>, ‘the tongue;’ <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">o lingua</i>, ‘the
interpreter:’ etc.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> In Italian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">podestà</i> (‘magistrate’)
is an instance of this. Feminine surnames, again, are
frequently added to masculine personal names: cf.
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alauda</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capella</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stella</i>; Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Colonna</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rosa</i>,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Barbarossa</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Malespina</i>, etc. So, in French, we find
names like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Marie</i>.</p>

<p>A word often takes a particular gender from the
fact that it belongs to a particular category. The gender
of the type of the species, in fact, fixes the gender for
other members classed with it. Thus, in English, the
word for <i>beast</i> comes from the O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beste</i> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête</span>), which is
feminine: but this word, and the names of beasts
generally, are treated in poetry as masculines, because
the Teutonic usage is to treat beasts generally as
masculine. Cf. <i>The beast is laid down in his lair</i>
(Cowper); <i>And when a beste is deed he ne hath no
peyne</i> (Chaucer, Cant. Tales, 1321); <i>The forest’s leaping
panther shall hide his spotted hide</i> (Bryant). Numerous
other instances are given by Mätzner.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> It is probable
that personification aids in fixing the gender in these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
cases. Similarly, in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">été</i> (‘summer’), from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstatem</i>, has become masculine because the other
seasons of the year were masculine. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Minuit</i> (‘midnight’)
has followed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">midi</i> (‘midday’); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">val</i> (‘valley’)
has followed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mont</i> (‘mountain’), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">font</i> (‘fount’) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fontaine</i>
(‘fountain’); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigle</i> (‘eagle’) is masculine because
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oiseau</i> (‘bird’) is masculine; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brebis</i> (‘wether’) is
feminine because <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ovis</i> (‘sheep’) is feminine; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sort</i>
(‘lot’) is masculine because <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonheur</i> (‘happiness’) is
masculine; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">art</i> (‘art’) is masculine because <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i> (‘profession’)
is masculine: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mer</i> (‘sea’) is feminine because
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terra</i> (‘land’) is feminine. In German, again, the
names of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tiber</i> and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rhone</i> have followed the model of
most German river names, and appear as feminine.
In Greek, many names of plants and trees have
become feminine, following the model of δρῦς (‘tree’)
and βοτάνη (‘grass’); cf. ὁ κύανος (‘steel’), ἡ κύανος
(‘the corn-flower’), so called from a fancied resemblance
between the plant and the metal. Towns, again, in
Greek, show an inclination to follow the gender of πόλις,
‘a city:’ cf. ἡ Κέραμος, from ὁ κέραμος, ‘clay;’ ἡ
Κισσός, from ὁ κισσός, ‘ivy;’ ἡ Μάραθος, from ὁ
μόραθος, ‘fennel.’</p>

<p>In other cases <i>formal</i> reasons have brought about
a change in gender. We have a striking example of
this in the feminine gender assumed by abstract nouns
in <i>-or</i> in the Romance languages, to which <i>flos</i>
(‘flower’) has also added itself. The fact was felt
that most abstract substantives were feminine, <i>e.g.</i>
those terminating in <i>-tas</i>, <i>-tus</i>, <i>-tudo</i>, <i>-tio</i>, <i>-itia</i>, <i>-ia</i>;
and, especially, the feminine termination <i>-ura</i> sometimes
was employed as an alternative to <i>-or</i>; cf. <i>pavor</i>
(‘fear’), Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">paura</i>. Again, in Latin, words in <i>-a</i>,
when these were not, like <i>poeta</i>, the names of males,
were commonly feminine. Consequently, we find that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Greek neuters in -μα appear in popular Latin as
feminines, a gender which they have in many cases
preserved in the Romance languages. Examples of
this are seen in <i>schème</i>, <i>dogme</i>, <i>diademe</i>, <i>anagramme</i>,
<i>énigme</i>, <i>épigramme</i>, etc. In the same way, in Modern
Greek, the old Greek feminines in -ος have in many
cases became masculine, as ὁ πλάτανος, ὁ κυπάρισσος,
‘the plain,’ ‘the cypress.’</p>

<p>Sometimes the termination appears altered to suit
the gender; thus the Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socrus</i> (‘a father-in-law’)
produces the Spanish word <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">suegra</i> (‘a mother-in-law’):
and, again, sometimes the traditional was the natural
gender; and this was an additional reason why the
word should alter its termination, instead of being
modified by the gender,&mdash;thus, in Greek, the α stems
which have become masculine, like νεανίας (‘a youth’),
have adopted the characteristic <i>s</i> of the masculine
nominative.</p>

<p>The way in which natural gender, as viewed by
imagination, has affected grammatical gender may be
well seen in English. The personal pronouns give
the only real traces of grammatical gender left in
English, <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>it</i>; <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, etc. On the other
hand, substantives are very commonly referred to
one sex or another by writers, and to some extent
personified. In these cases sometimes a faint tradition
of their Anglo-Saxon gender seems to have lingered,
as when, for instance, mammals and reptiles are in
poetry spoken of as masculine; e.g., <i>Like the roe</i>
(A.S. <i>rá</i>, fem.) <i>when he hears</i> (Longfellow); <i>I have
seen the hyena’s</i> (Lat. and Fr. fem.) <i>eyes of flame, and
heard at my side his stealthy tread</i> (Bryant). Birds,
on the other hand, are treated very often as feminines,
irrespective of the grammatical gender possessed by
their Anglo-Saxon or French original; cf. <i>But the sea-fowl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
has gone to her nest</i> (Cowper); <i>A bird betrays her
nest by striving to conceal it</i> (Byron); <i>Jealous as the
eagle of her high aiery</i> (ibid.); <i>The raven flaps her
wing</i> (ibid.); <i>A hawk hits her prey</i> (Halliwell, s.v.
ruff); <i>The swan rows her state</i> (Milton).</p>

<p>We must mention one more point which ought not
to be overlooked, though, owing to the scanty survival
of grammatical gender in modern English, it cannot
easily be illustrated by English examples. We have
indicated some of the causes which have been active
in producing a change of gender; but, besides these,
there is a negative one, viz., the absence of impediment
to such change, which, in a certain sense, may
be said to have contributed to the same effect. The
distinction in gender which is even yet marked in
French and German by the different forms of the
singular article (<i>le</i>, <i>der</i>, masc.; <i>la</i>, <i>die</i>, fem.; <i>das</i>,
neut.) has long since disappeared in the plural. We
find <i>les</i>, <i>die</i> for all genders. And hence it is clear that
such words as were most frequently used in the plural
were least closely associated with a particular gender,
and were therefore more especially amenable to the
influence of any force tending to group them with
words of a gender different from their own. For
instance, most feminine nouns in German form their
plural by adding <i>-en</i> to the singular, while few masculine
and only six or seven neuter nouns do the like;
as a result of which many nouns, formerly masculine,
are now feminine, and this especially applies to cases
where the plural was in frequent use.</p>

<p>The neuter, the sexless, owes its origin as a
grammatical category merely to the development and
differentiation of the two other genders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Number.</span></h3>

<p>As in the case of gender, so, before number passed
into a grammatical category, concord must have been
developed. Even in languages which, like English,
would naturally express the plural by some plural
termination, we find words denoting a plurality, and,
indeed, a definite number, conceived and spoken of as
a unity. Such are <i>a pair</i>, <i>a leash</i>, <i>a brace</i>, <i>a triplet</i>,
<i>a trio</i>, <i>a quartette</i>, <i>a dozen</i>, <i>a score</i>.</p>

<p>We find similar cases in the most varied languages:
cf. the Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une dizaine</i> (‘a collection of ten’), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une
douzaine</i> (‘a dozen’), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">centaine</i> (‘a collection of a
hundred’), etc.; Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">una diecina</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dozzina</i>, etc.; <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">trave</i>,
in Danish, means ‘a <i>score</i> of corn sheaves;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schock</i>, in
German, means ‘sixty;’ <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">tchetvero</i>, in Russian, means
‘a set of four.’ We may add, the curious Latin word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quimatus</i>, ‘the age of five years.’</p>

<p>Thus, in like manner, so-called collective nouns
are simply comprehensive singular designations of
plurality. Now, the speaker or writer may choose to
think of the collective of which he is speaking as a
unity or as a plurality, and the way in which he chooses
to regard it may affect the concord; nay, it may even
affect the gender.</p>

<p>The most common case is where a plural verb
follows a singular collective noun: as, ‘The whole
nation <i>seem</i> to be running out of their wits’ (Smollett,
Humphrey Clinker); ‘The army of the Queen <i>mean</i>
to besiege us’ (Shakespeare, 3 Hen. VI., I. ii.);<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
cf. ‘Even until King Arthur’s <i>table</i>, man by man, had
fallen in Lyonness about <i>their</i> Lord’ (Tennyson, Idylls
of the King); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Pars perexigua</i>, duce amisso</span>, Romam
<i>inermes delati sunt</i>’ (Livy, ii. 14) = ‘A very small part,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
their leader lost, <i>were brought unarmed</i> to Rome;’
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cetera classis</i>, prætoria nave amissa, <i>fugerunt</i></span>’ (Livy,
xxxv. 26) = ‘The rest of the fleet, with the loss of
the prætorian ship, fled (plur.).’ Sometimes there is a
mixture of singular and plural, e.g. ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fremit improba
plebes</i> (sing.) Sontibus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accensæ</i> (plur.) stimulis’ (Stat.,
Theb., v. 488) = ‘The <i>impatient people murmur</i> (sing.),
<i>inflamed</i> (plur. part.) etc.:’ cf. the following examples
from the Greek&mdash;Μέρος τι (sing.) ανθρώπων οὐκ ἡγοῦνται
(plur.) θεούς (Plato., Leg., 948) = ‘A <i>portion</i> of mankind
<i>do</i> not believe in gods;’ Τό στράτευμα ἐπορίζετο
(sing.) σῖτον, κόπτοντες (plur.) τοὺς βοῦς καὶ ονους (Xen.,
Anab., II. i. 6) = ‘The army provided itself with food
(by) cutting up (plur. part.) the oxen and asses.’</p>

<p>In A.S., when <i>ðæt</i> or <i>ðis</i> is connected with a plural
predicate by means of the verb ‘to be,’ the verb is put
in the plural: ‘Eall <i>ðæt sindon</i> micle and egeslice dæda’
(‘All <i>that</i> are great and terrible deeds.’) Conversely,
where we should say ‘each of those who <i>hear</i>,’ the
idiom in Anglo-Saxon was to say ‘each of those who
<i>hears</i>:’ as, ‘Ælc ðára ðe ðás míne word <i>gehyrð</i>’ (= ‘Each
of those who <i>hears</i> these my words’, where the verb
is made to agree, not with <i>ðara ðe</i>, but with <i>ælc</i>. Cf.
Sweet, Anglo-Saxon Reader, p. xci.).</p>

<p>We find many words so commonly combined with
the plural, that we more naturally apprehend them as
plural than as singular; such a word is the English ‘people,’
which we instinctively connect with a plural verb.
In such cases, we sometimes even find that the grammatical
form actually assimilates itself to the psychological
number, as when we speak of <i>folks</i>; cf. also <i>sheeps</i> in
Shakespeare (Love’s Labour’s lost, II. i.); while from
the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gent</i>, which was used in Old French
with the plural, we find formed, in the same way, the
word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens</i>: in Italian we find <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">genti</i> beside <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gente</i>. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Anglo-Saxon, <i>-waru</i> denotes ‘a nation,’ ‘a defence:’
the plural <i>-ware</i>, ‘citizens;’ as <i>Rómware</i>, ‘the men of
Rome;’ <i>Cantwáre</i>, ‘the men of Kent,’ etc. In Gothic,
there is a collective neuter <i>fadrein</i>, which we may illustrate
or parallel, though not exactly translate, by the
word ‘fathership.’ In the singular (genitive) it is used
in the meaning of ‘race’ or ‘family’ (Eph. iii. 15), thus
showing its original abstract and then collective sense;
and again it is found (Luke viii. 56) still singular but
with a plural verb: <i>jah usgeisnodedun fadrein izos</i> = <i>and
were-astonished fathership</i> (i.e. <small>PARENTS</small>) <i>her</i> = <i>and her
parents were astonished</i>. We even find the singular
noun with the <i>article</i> (<i>i.e.</i> demonstrative pronoun) <i>in the
plural</i>: <i>Andhofun ðan im ðai fadrein is jah qeðun</i> =
<i>Answered then to him those fathership his and said</i> = <i>Then
answered his parents and said</i> (John ix. 20). It is, thus,
this <i>plural meaning</i> which caused the word to be used
in the <i>plural form</i>, exactly as we use <i>folks</i> quoted
above, while the etymological meaning as abstract collective
was overlooked. For example: <i>Ni auk skulun
barna</i> <small>FADREINAM</small> <i>huzdjan, ak</i> <small>FADREINA</small> <i>barnam</i> = <i>not
eke shall bairns for</i> <small>FATHERSHIPS</small> <i>hoard, but</i> <small>FATHERSHIPS</small>
<i>for bairns</i>, i.e. <i>For the children shall not hoard for
the parents, but the parents for the children</i> (2 Cor.
xii. 14).<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>The converse of this also happens. A plural
expression receives the function of a singular when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
parts thus indicated are thought of as a whole. Thus
we can talk of <i>another sixpence</i>, <i>another hundred yards</i>;
or even use phrases like <i>There’s not another two such
women</i> (Warren); <i>this seven year</i> (Shakes., Much Ado,
III. 3.); <i>What is six winters?</i> (Rich. II., I. iii.).
<i>Amends</i>, <i>gallows</i>, <i>sessions</i>, <i>shambles</i> are plurals, but are
generally treated as singulars; e.g., <i>a shrewd unhappy
gallows</i> (Love’s Labour’s lost, V. ii. 12). So, too, <i>works</i>,
<i>scales</i>, etc.: e.g., <i>that crystal scales</i> (Rom. and Jul., I. ii.
101); <i>Stoppage of a large steelworks</i> (Weekly Times and
Echo, August 19, 1888); <i>Fire in a Liverpool chemical
works</i> (Liverpool Daily Post, June 30, 1884, p. 7);
<i>This is good news</i>; etc. Finally, such plurals become
singular, not only in sense, but even in form, and are
treated and declined as such. Thus, in English, we
talk of <i>an invoice</i> (Fr. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">envoi</span>s, plur.). In Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra</i>
(plur.) sometimes formed a genitive of singular form,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castræ</i>:<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> the plural <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litteræ</i>, in sense of ‘an epistle,’ has
passed into the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre</i> as singular, with a new
plural, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettres</i>; the Latin plural <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vela</i>, ‘sails,’ into French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une voile</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minaciæ</i> has become the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menace</i>,
‘threat,’ and the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">minaccia</i>: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nuptiæ</i>, ‘nuptials,’
has become, in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noce</i>, ‘a wedding,’ as well as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noces</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tenebræ</i>, ‘darkness’ has become, in Spanish,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tiniebla</i>, as well as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tinieblas</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deliciæ</i>, ‘delights,’ in
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">délice</i>, as well as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">délices</i>. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pâques</i>, ‘Easter,’
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Athènes</i>, ‘Athens,’ are used as singulars.</p>

<p>Pronouns referring to abstract expressions stand
sometimes in the plural; as, <i>Nobody knows what it is
to lose a friend till</i> <small>THEY</small> <i>have lost him</i> (Fielding).
Again, the predicate may stand in the plural;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> as,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quisque suos</i> <small>PATIMUR</small> <i>manes</i></span> (Verg., Æn., 743)&mdash;‘We
each suffer our own ghostly punishment,’ where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quisque</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
‘each’ in singular, but the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patimur</i> is plural.
Similar are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uterque educunt</i> (Cæs., C., iii. 30); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>uter</i>
<small>ERATIS</small></span> (Plaut., Men., 1119); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>neuter ad me</i> <small>IRETIS</small></span>;
<i>Every one of these letters</i> <small>ARE</small> <i>in my name</i> (Shakespeare,
Twelfth Night, II. v.); <i>Neither of them</i> <small>ARE</small> <i>remarkable</i>
(Blair); <i>Every one to rest</i> <small>THEMSELVES BETAKE</small> (Rape of
Lucrece, 125); <i>when neither</i> <small>ARE</small> <i>alive</i> (Cymb., IV. ii.
252). Most Indo-European languages possess pairs
of pronouns, in each of which sets one properly denotes
the singular, the other plurality; as in English <i>all</i>,
<i>every</i>; or <i>each</i>, and <i>any</i>: and these are readily interchanged;
e.g., <i>without all doubt</i> (Shakes., Hen. VIII.,
IV. i. 113), <i>less attemptable than any the rarest of our
ladies</i> (Cymb., I. iv. 65). Thus, even in Latin, the
singular <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnis</i> is used where we should have expected
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes</i>; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">militat omnis amans</i> (Ovid, Amor., I. ix. 1).
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu pulses omne quod obstat</i> (Hor., Sat. II., vi. 30).
Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">totus</i> has passed into the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout</i>, ‘all.’ We
find <i>both</i> in Shakespeare, connected with the singular;
<i>Both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies</i>,
i.e. <i>the remedy for us both</i> (Rom. and Jul., II. iii.
51). Thus, also, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">autrui</i>, ‘others,’ in French, really
the oblique case of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">autre</i>, is in fact a singular, but is
looked upon as a plural; as, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la rigueur envers autrui</i>
(Massillon).</p>

<p>Number, in the sense of singular or plural, cannot,
again, be properly predicated of the simple names of
materials. We do not think of them as individuals,
except in connection with form as well as matter,&mdash;in
fact, till we think of substances as divided as well as
divisible. Hence it is that the names of materials
occur mostly in the singular number; the fact being
that if there were a <i>neuter number</i>, i.e. a grammatical
form expressive of neither plural nor singular, we
should naturally employ it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>But the name of a material is readily used as that
of an individual object, and, on the other hand, the
name of an individual object may easily come to be
the designation of a material. The imagination
supplies or withdraws, as it may be, the form and
definite shape which, as we have seen, is essential to
number. Take such instances as <i>hair</i>, <i>grass</i>, <i>bloom</i>,
<i>fruit</i>, <i>weed</i>, <i>grain</i>, <i>cloth</i>, <i>stone</i>, <i>wood</i>, <i>field</i>, <i>meadow</i>,
<i>marsh</i>, <i>heath</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>land</i>, <i>bread</i>, <i>cake</i>, etc. Similarly,
when we talk of <i>fowl</i> as a viand, we individualise and
give form to a general conception; as, in French, when
we talk about <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du porc</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du mouton</i>. In the same way,
we have in Latin such expressions as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leporem et
gallinam et anserem</i> for ‘<i>the flesh of</i> the hare, the fowl,
and the goose;’ and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fagum atque abietem</i> for ‘the beech
tree and the fir-tree’ (Cæsar, Bell. Gall., v. 12). In the
same way, we must explain the singular in cases like
<i>The enemy is approaching</i>; <i>The Russian is within hail</i>.
Similarly, Livy uses the singular, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanus</i> for ‘the
Romans,’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poenus</i> for ‘the Carthaginians,’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eques</i> for
‘the cavalry,’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pedes</i> for ‘the infantry,’ etc.; nay, he even
goes as far as to combine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hispani milites et funditor
Balearis</i> (xxvii. 2).</p>

<p>Thus, too, Horace ventures on the combination
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miles nautæque</i> (Sat. I., i.). Vergil has <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plurima mortis
imago</i>, ‘many an image of death’ (Æn., ii. 369); in
Seneca, we even find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multo hoste</i>, ‘many an enemy.’</p>

<p>In German, the singular of many words stands
constantly after numerals; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tausend mann</i>, ‘a thousand
men,’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zehn stück Pferde</i>, ‘ten head (lit. pieces) of horses.’
Similarly it was usual to write in English such expressions
as <i>many score thousand</i>: <i>twenty score paces</i>.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
The fact is, that there is no need for any special
designation of plurality to follow a number; the plurality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
is already sufficiently denoted by the number
itself.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> We thus see that the form taken by such a
word would naturally be <i>numberless</i>, or <i>absolute</i>, in fact,
would be treated in the same way as it would have
been treated before the rise of grammatical number.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tense.</span></h3>

<p>It is the function of the various ‘tenses’ to express
the temporal relation of an event, when considered
with regard to a certain moment. At the outset,
however, we must observe that the tenses actually
existing in any given language do not by any means
perfectly correspond to the varieties possible and
logically distinguishable in these relations. We will
first consider what would be indispensable to a logically
complete system.</p>

<p>Any event whatever must necessarily be anterior,
contemporary, or posterior, to the moment with respect
to which it is considered; and this moment must itself
be past, present, or future. Hence, according as the
moment of comparison is varied, we get the following
<span class="nowrap">sets:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I. <i>Moment of comparison</i> <span class="smcap">Present</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The event is stated <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>) <small>NOW</small> <i>past</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>1</sub>) <small>NOW</small> <i>present</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>) <small>NOW</small> <i>still to come</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>II. <i>Moment of comparison</i> <span class="smcap">Past</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The event is stated to have <span class="nowrap">been&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>) <small>THEN</small> <i>already past</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>2</sub>) <small>THEN</small> <i>present</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>2</sub>) <small>THEN</small> <i>still to come</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>III. <i>Moment of comparison</i> <span class="smcap">Future</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is stated that the <span class="nowrap">event&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>3</sub>) <i>will</i> <small>THEN</small> <i>be past</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>3</sub>) <i>will</i> <small>THEN</small> <i>be present</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>3</sub>) <i>will</i> <small>THEN</small> <i>be still to come</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>The above nine subdivisions exhaust all possibilities as
long as we employ but a single ‘moment of comparison’
in each case; and it is so important that this
point should be fully realised, that, simple as it appears,
we proceed to illustrate each division as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>) Cæsar once <i>said</i>, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</span>.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>1</sub>) I now <i>believe</i> that this is true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>) I expect that he <i>will come</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>) When I entered, he <i>had gone</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>2</sub>) When I entered, he <i>was speaking</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>2</sub>) When I entered, he <i>was going to speak</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i><sub>3</sub>) On New Year’s day I <i>shall have completed</i> my fiftieth year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i><sub>3</sub>) I <i>shall</i> then <i>receive</i> a letter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>c</i><sub>3</sub>) I <i>shall</i> then <i>be going to write</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is at once apparent here that in some of these
cases we are forced to have recourse to periphrasis,
and that in some we use tenses which might also serve
in other divisions. This, for instance, may be seen by
comparing <i>b</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, or, at any rate, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i><sub>3</sub>. But
before discussing these points we must pay a little
more attention to the above scheme, not, indeed, as
it actually exists, but as it might conceivably exist.</p>

<p>It is by no means inconceivable, and quite in
accordance with logic, that we should wish to employ
<i>two</i> moments of comparison instead of <i>one</i>, especially
in some of the cases falling under II. and III. In <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,
for instance, the event might be <i>then</i> still to come, but
<i>now</i> α) past, (β) present, (γ) even yet to come.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>This at first seems fanciful; but while the example
we employed to illustrate <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> does not necessarily
convey as much, still most hearers would naturally
interpret it as follows: “When I entered, his speaking
was still in the future, but now (unless some hindrance,
as yet unstated, has intervened) it belongs to the past.”
Again, if, on the other hand, we take a sentence like
<i>He has promised to do so</i>; in the first place, it is found
to <small>STATE</small> that the promise was given in the past, when
as yet the action of fulfilment belonged to the future;
and, secondly, to <small>IMPLY</small> that this action of fulfilment
belongs to the future <i>still</i>.</p>

<p>Further, it is logically possible, and often necessary,
to make a statement about some event without any
reference to time; when, for instance, a statement is
true at any time, or at no time at all. The form
employed in such cases ought, in strict agreement with
our definition of ‘tense,’ to be called ‘tenseless’ or
‘absolute;’ but it is well known that, in English and
all Indo-European languages, the ‘present’ is the tense
employed. In <i>Man is mortal</i> the copula <i>is</i> cannot
justly be called ‘present’ tense, for the statement is
wholly abstract, and applies equally to past, present,
and future; yet it is customary and convenient to
apply the term ‘present’ even to the word <i>is</i> as thus
used.</p>

<p>This use of the present sometimes gives rise to a
certain ambiguity. If, in speaking of a child, we say
<i>He is very troublesome</i>, the statement may mean <i>He is
at this moment very troublesome</i>, in which case the verb
<i>is</i> is <i>present</i> tense proper; or it may mean <i>He is a
troublesome child</i>, whence the sentence becomes <i>abstract-concrete</i><a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
and the verb <i>is</i> tense <i>absolute</i>.</p>

<p>If, as in the case of grammatical gender and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
number, these distinctions of form are to be regarded
as later developments in the case of the grammatical
tenses of the verb, we must assume (i.) that the same
form must once have served indifferently for all tense
relations, and (ii.) expect that the tenses actually
differentiated will (<i>a</i>) correspond only incompletely
with the scheme of logical distinctions, (<i>b</i>) will in
various languages show various deviations from the
ideal scheme, and (<i>c</i>) will, in the same language at
different periods of its history, show similar variations
in those deviations.</p>

<p>i. Though the conclusion under head i. is actually
inevitable, it seems, at first sight, improbable and
doubtful; but, in addition to the use of the present
tense discussed and exemplified above, there is much
in modern English which may help to illustrate and
enable us to realise it, while older languages afford
much more material for the same purpose. A usage
closely akin to that of the <i>present</i> tense for tense
<i>absolute</i> occurs when the <i>present</i> is used for the <i>future</i>,
and more especially when some other word in the
sentence definitely refers the event to the future.
Thus, in <i>I am going to London to-morrow</i>, we actually
employ that specially English periphrasis which is
never used in the <i>absolute</i> sense, but, as a rule,
emphatically expresses that the action belongs to the
present time.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Nay, where circumstances are sufficiently
unequivocal to absolutely preclude the meaning of the
present tense, the addition of such words as <i>to-morrow</i>,
etc., is not even needed. If two friends, for instance,
were speaking about some coming holidays, and the
one had said, <i>I think I will go to Wales</i>, the other
might answer, <i>I don’t care for Wales, I am going to</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
<i>London</i>; or, again, without such explanatory circumstances,
or any special words, the <i>present</i> in a subordinate
clause can stand for a <i>future</i> event, provided
that the main clause grammatically expresses the
future; e.g., <i>I will call you when he comes</i>.</p>

<p>We also sometimes use the <small>PRESENT TENSE FOR
THE PAST</small>. This we do (<i>a</i>) where the event is equally
true of the past as of the present; e.g., <i>I know that</i> =
<i>I know it, and knew it some time ago</i>&mdash;a case in which
the present tense expresses past <small>AND</small> present together:
or (<i>b</i>) where the event belongs, indeed, entirely to the
<i>past</i>, but the result is represented as actually <i>present</i>.
Of (<i>b</i>) these are instances: ‘Master <i>sends</i> me to tell
you,’ ‘He <i>tells</i> me that he is going away,’ ‘I <i>hear</i> he
is better now.’ This usage approaches closely to a
third (<i>c</i>), the so-called <i>Historic present</i>, which, however,
we should probably not consider as a present tense expressing
the past, but as a simple present, whose use
is due to the vivid imagination of the speaker, when it
leads him to regard the past as actually present.</p>

<p>We have said that the consciousness of the result
of an action sometimes causes the use of a present
tense for a past event. The same cause may also
lead to an exactly opposite usage, viz., that of a past
tense for an event in the present. Thus, as the result
of <i>seeing</i> is <i>knowing</i>, it came to pass that a form
originally signifying <i>I have seen</i> acquired the meaning
<i>I know</i>; the Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich weisz</i> means ‘I know,’ but is
derived from the same root as the Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Video</i>, ‘I see.’
Thus, again, the root which we find in Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gno-sco</i>
(= <i>I begin to learn</i>, <i>I get to know</i>) appears in the
English <i>I can</i>, which, exactly as the Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi</i> (for
*<i>gnovi</i>, cf. <i>agnovi</i> for <i>ad-gnovi</i>), meant <i>I have got to
know</i> (= <i>I know</i>), has developed its present meaning,
I am able, from one expressive of something like <i>I have</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
<i>become able</i>, or <i>I have learned</i>. It is thus that arose
the so-called ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præterito-presentia</span>,’ <i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>shall</i>,
etc., which still betray, one and all, their origin from a
former grammatical past tense, by absence of <i>s</i> as a
characteristic termination of the third person singular&mdash;a
termination which we add to the stem in the case
of all other present tenses.</p>

<p>Logically, the relation between some tenses of the
same verb, as, <i>e.g.</i>, the present <small>TENSE</small> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognosco</i> (‘I get
to know’) and the perfect <small>TENSE</small> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi</i> (‘I have got to
know’), which is used as a present tense to express the
result, is identical with that between many sets of
verbs. In fact we might translate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognosco</i> by <span class="smcap">I learn</span>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi</i> by <span class="smcap">I know</span>. Similar sets are <i>to step</i>, <i>to stand</i>;
<i>to fall</i>, <i>to lie</i>; etc. But here, again, this distinction
need not to be expressed, or, at least, is not always
expressed; the same form may serve for both. Not
to refer to dead languages or obsolete forms, it is
sufficient to quote the well-known schoolboy’s expression,
<i>He stood him on the form</i>, for <i>He made him
stand on the form</i>. So, also, <i>He stood the candle on the
floor</i> (Dickens).<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>Now, all this confusion of past for present, present
for past, effect for cause, cause for effect, present for
future, present for every relation, causes in practice,
as we have already seen, little or no ambiguity. If
we remember this, it becomes easy for us to realize
how conversation and intelligible statement may once
have been quite possible without further aid than that
afforded by what we call the tense <i>absolute</i>, i.e. a form
of the verb expressive of the action only, without any
indication of its time. A glance at a tense system
<i>very</i> different from our own, will enable us to do this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
even more fully, and at the same time will to some
extent illustrate our statement that, in different languages,
the actually existing tenses correspond variously
with the logical scheme. In Hebrew, the verb
has three different forms, called respectively (<i>a</i>) imperative,
(<i>b</i>) perfect, (<i>c</i>) imperfect; which terms, however,
might be replaced for the occasion by (<i>a</i>)
<i>command</i> tense, (<i>b</i>) <i>finished</i> tense, (<i>c</i>) <i>unfinished</i> tense,
lest they should mislead readers who have not studied
Hebrew. Instead of ‘tense,’ we might as correctly
call them ‘moods.’</p>

<p>The context is the sole guide as to whether the
event spoken of belongs to past, present, or future.
In narrative, the perfect and imperfect serve very
much the same purposes as the tenses similarly named
in Latin; but the <i>imperfect</i>, as tense or mood of <i>unfinished</i>
action, serves also for our present and future,
while a future which is to represent something as
<i>certainly</i> expected, is supplied by the <i>perfect</i> or <i>finished</i>
tense. Again, the imperfect serves for the optative
(<i>wish</i> mood), and also sometimes replaces the imperative,
since the latter is essentially a mood of action as
yet unperformed. In this latter use of the imperfect
there is sometimes a slight differentiation of form.</p>

<p>ii. <i>a.</i> The fact that the grammatical tenses correspond
very incompletely with the logical distinctions,
has already been very fully illustrated by all we have
said in this chapter, and it only remains to add a few
words on what are termed in our grammars ‘the compound
tenses.’ Strictly speaking, these are not tenses
at all of the verbs to which they are said to belong:
of tenses, <i>i.e.</i> forms derived from the verb itself, and
expressive of definite relations of time, there are but
two in English&mdash;the present, and the past or imperfect.
The enumeration of the so-called compound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
tenses amongst the tenses proper is due to a confusion
between logic and grammar, only slightly removed
from the fiction which gave us the still lingering
potential mood (<i>I can write</i>), or which might with
equal correctness have given us an obligatory mood
(<i>I must write</i>), a desiderative mood (<i>I like to write</i>),
an obstinate mood (<i>I am determined to write</i>), etc., etc.
In English we now employ various periphrases for all
relations but the present and that indicated by the
imperfect; and the line which separates a ‘future
tense’ <i>I will write</i>, from a phrase like <i>I have the intention
of writing</i>, is a perfectly arbitrary one.</p>

<p>ii. <i>b.</i> Our short and necessarily very incomplete
discussion of the Hebrew tenses furnished an instance
of what we stated under ii. <i>b</i>, p. 256; and there is no
need to further illustrate this, especially as any reader
acquainted with a foreign language knows how much
care is requisite in translating the various English
tenses in their different applications. Any student of,
say, French or German will recognise this; while, in
the case of those who know English alone, no amount
of illustration of the point in question could raise their
knowledge above mere acceptance on authority, or
belief at second hand.</p>

<p>To illustrate ii. <i>c</i>, we shall only give a few instances
of (α) the use in English (Modern English
and Anglo-Saxon) of a present tense where we should
now employ a future (which latter was then, as now,
non-existent as a tense, the only difference being that
the present periphrasis had not then yet become customary),
and of (β) the use of a simple past tense
where we should now employ the plu-perfect:&mdash;</p>

<p>α. <i>Æfter ðrím dagon ic áríse</i> = ‘After three days
I <i>arise</i>’ (Matt. xxvii. 63); <i>Gá gé on mínne wíngeard,
and ic sylle eow ðæt riht bið</i> = ‘Go ye into my vineyard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
and I <i>give</i> (= <i>shall give</i>) you what right is’
(Matt. xx. 4).</p>

<p>β. <i>Hé mid ðám léohte his gást ágeaf ðam Drihtne ðe
hine to his ríce gelaðode</i> = ‘He with the light his spirit
gave-up to the Lord who him to his Kingdom <i>invited</i>
(i.e., <i>had invited</i>)’ (Ælfric; cf. Skeat, Anglo-Saxon
Reader, i., p. 86): <i>Hé ne grétte hi oð ðæt héo cende hyre
sunu</i> = ‘He not knew her until that she <i>brought forth</i>
(= <i>had brought forth</i>) her son.’</p>

<p>In our preceding remarks, we have had occasion
to mention that, in Hebrew, the categories of tense
and mood are scarcely differentiated. Similarly&mdash;to
some extent&mdash;in Sanscrit, the distinction between
what we call tenses and moods is less clearly defined
than in, <i>e.g.</i>, Latin or Greek. Of this confusion, or
rather absence of distinction, we preserve some traces
in modern usage. Thus, as the imperative is essentially
significant of something still to come, we can
understand how a future <small>TENSE</small> can come to be employed
instead of an imperative <small>MOOD</small>. Such a phrase
as <i>You will do that at once</i>, especially when aided by
accent or emphasis, can be used for ‘You <i>shall</i>, etc.’
Nay, the future is occasionally used as <small>OPTATIVE</small>; e.g.
<i>Sic me di amabunt</i>, = <i>So the gods will love me</i>, for <i>May
the gods love me</i>: and even as <small>DUBITATIVE</small>, as in the
Scottish <i>Ye’ll no be o’ this country, freend?</i> (Scott,
Mannering, ch. i.) = ‘You will not be of this country,’
<i>i.e.</i> ‘I suppose you are not, etc.’</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Voice.</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that what in formal grammar appears
as the ‘object’ of a verb is often, from a psychological
point of view, the subject of a sentence (cf.
Chap. VI.). The use of the passive voice enables us
to do away with this incongruence: the object of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
action becomes the subject of our sentence, and the
grammatical construction is thus made to harmonise
with the psychological instinct. For instance, if, in
answer to the question <i>Whom does he prefer as companion?</i>
we say <i>John he would prefer</i>, we overcome,
by a construction somewhat alien to the genius of the
English language, the difficulty of expressing that
John, the object of the verb to prefer, is in our mind
the subject of a statement: <i>John is the person whom
he would prefer</i>.</p>

<p>But such an inversion as <i>John he would prefer</i> is
not always possible; while such an extension as <i>John
is the person whom he would prefer</i>, though, indeed,
always a possible construction, would be felt as very
awkward and needlessly lengthy. This difficulty is
evaded by the use of the passive voice: and the use
of this voice serves to give clearness and elegance to
style.</p>

<p>It is, however, perhaps not superfluous to point
out that, whether we employ the active or the passive
voice, the <small>ACTUAL</small> relation existing between the subject
and object of our sentence remains the same.
Whether we say <i>John loves Mary</i>, or <i>Mary is loved by
John</i>, the person <i>John</i> is in either case described as
the agent; the person <i>Mary</i> is the object of the
feeling expressed by the verb. It is the <i>form</i> only of
the two sentences which differs; it is the <i>syntactical</i>,
and not the <i>real</i> relation of subject and object which
varies. Hence we may say that the distinction of
voice in the verb is to some extent purely syntactical
in its nature. It is, moreover, clear that the distinction
implied in voice could not arise before the distinction
between the grammatical subject and object had
been established. Until such was the case, mere
juxtaposition of substantive and verb must have served
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
equally as the expression of the active and of the
passive relation between subject and predicate.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar phenomenon, possibly a
survival of this prehistoric stage, is observable in the
nominal forms of the verb, which, though indeed
already specialised in the earliest stages of those
languages with which we are acquainted, contain
nothing in their actual formation which can assign
them to either voice. And, again, if we consider
fully the Latin genitives known in grammar as <i>objective</i>
and <i>subjective</i>, we find a similar indefiniteness of
expression prevalent as to relationship active or
passive. <i>Amor patris</i> (‘love, father’s’) can, according
to the context, signify either the love which the father
feels, or that which is felt for the father by some one
else.</p>

<p>The present participle, now always called <i>active</i>, is
even yet sometimes used in a passive meaning, and
this use was formerly much more common. We hear,
even at the present day, such phrases as <i>Do you want
the tea making?</i> <i>I want my coat brushing</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
Again, we have expressions like <i>One thing is wanting</i>,
common now as in Shakespeare’s time;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> <i>so much is
owing</i>, etc. Other instances not less striking have
become obsolete: as, <i>his unrecalling crime</i> (Rape of
Lucrece, l. 993) for <i>unrecalled</i> = ‘not to be recalled;’
and <i>his all-obeying breath</i> (Ant. and Cleop., III. xiii. 77)
= his breath obeyed by all. We find, also, <i>Relish your
nimble notes to pleasing ears</i> (= pleased ears) in Rape
of Lucrece, l. 1126.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>In Gothic there is a remarkable and indeed unique
instance of this use (Mark xv. 15): <i>Atgaf Jesu usbliggvands</i>,
i.e. <i>(Pilate) gave Jesus scourging</i> = <i>gave up
Jesus to be scourged</i>, or <i>for being scourged</i>.</p>

<p>The so-called gerundives in Latin have commonly
a passive meaning; thus, <i>amandus</i> usually means ‘fit to
be loved.’ But here, again, we meet with exceptional
uses which prove that what is now regarded as the
‘regular’ meaning is in reality but accidental and
adventitious. <i>Oriundus</i> means ‘arising’ and, in
somewhat older Latin, we find forms like <i>pereundus</i>,
‘perishing,’ <i>placendus</i>, ‘pleasing,’ etc.</p>

<p>Little as the distinction of voice is expressed in the
<i>nomen actionis</i>, it is equally little inherent in the
infinite. In such a sentence as <i>I gave him a good
beating</i>, the meaning of <i>beating</i> is active; in the
sentence <i>He got a good beating</i>, it is decidedly passive.
Similarly, in such a sentence as <i>I can read</i>, the infinitive
is active, but this is owing to the context: for
instance, in such a sentence as <i>This is not easy to
read</i>, it is clearly passive. Yet no one would call
these phrases ambiguous. We can therefore easily
imagine that infinitives may have existed long before
they were differentiated into separate forms to mark
the two voices. We still employ many infinitives
which might be called neuter, neither active nor
passive: such as, for instance, ‘Is it better <i>to say</i> yes
or <i>to say</i> no?’ ‘fair <i>to see</i>;’ ‘a marvel <i>to tell</i>.’</p>

<p>In Gothic, however, we find many instances of
infinitives which, being commonly employed as
actives, are conveniently considered as belonging to
that particular voice; but which, in special sentences,
have a very clearly defined passive sense. Thus,
<i>qêmun ðan môtarjôs daupjan</i> = <i>Came then publicans (to)
baptise</i> = <i>to be baptised</i> (Luke iii. 12); <i>Untê sunus mans</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
<i>skulds ist atgiban in handuns mannê</i> = <i>For (the) son
(of) man due is (= must) deliver into hands (of) men</i> =
<i>shall be delivered into</i>. (Luke ix. 44); <i>Varð ðan gasviltan
ðamma unlêdin jah briggan fram aggilum in barma
Abrahamis</i> = <i>(It) happened then (to) die (to) the beggar
and (to) bring from (= by) angels into (the) bosom (of)
Abraham</i> = <i>It came to pass that the beggar died and was
carried, etc.</i> (Luke xvi. 22); <i>du saihvan</i> = <i>to see</i> = <i>for
being seen</i> (Matt. vi. 1), etc.</p>

<p>Though, then, in these and similar cases we find
infinitive forms with unquestionably passive meanings,
it would not be quite correct to assign them in formal
grammar to the passive voice.</p>

<p>A grammatical passive is only acknowledged in
cases where that passive has been formed from the
same stem as the active, and has been marked off from
it by a special method of formation, as in such cases
as <i>amo</i>, ‘I love,’ <i>amor</i>, ‘I am loved.’ The relation of
an intransitive verb to its corresponding causative,
resembles that of a passive to its active, as in such
cases as <i>to fall</i>, <i>to fell</i>; <i>to drink</i>, <i>to drench</i>; <i>to sit</i>, <i>to set</i>:
and the pairs from roots etymologically unrelated, <i>to
make</i>, <i>to become</i>; <i>to kill</i>, <i>to die</i>. In the case of the
intransitive verbs, however, as compared with that of
the grammatical passive, we do not dwell so much in
thought upon an operating cause as constituting the
difference between active and passive. But this distinction
is so slight, that we actually find intransitive
verbs used with a sequence such as we should expect
after a passive, as in <i>He died by the hand of the public
executioner</i>; <i>He fell by his own ambition</i>. On the
other hand, we can see the transition from the passive
to the active in the case of the Russian&mdash;where the
active form is employed to express a passive sense,&mdash;and
of the so-called deponent verbs. We have to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
translate a form like the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verti</i> by ‘to turn,’
employing the middle voice. A case like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jam homo
in mercaturâ vortitur</i>, ‘The man is now busy with
merchandise’ (Plautus, Mostellaria, III. i. 109) may
serve to show how nearly allied is the middle or
passive voice to the deponent proper. No doubt a
true deponent differs from a verb used in the middle
voice, by the fact that the deponent takes an accusative
after it; but how nearly the two touch one
another, may be gathered from such instances as that
given above, by the side of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversari regem</i> (Tac.,
Hist., iv. 84,), ‘to oppose, or to oppose one’s-self to,
the king.’</p>

<p>One of the most common ways, in which the
passive takes its origin, is from the middle voice,
which is sometimes seen to be formed from the composition
of the active with the reflective pronoun. We
have in English two examples of this method of
formation, in the words <i>(to) bask and (to) busk</i>: <i>to bask</i>
means ‘to bathe one’s-self;’ <i>to busk</i>, ‘to prepare one’s-self,’
or ‘get ready.’<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> The <i>sk</i> stands for <i>sik</i>, as it appears
in Icelandic, the accusative case of a reflective pronoun
of the third person. The Russian often, in like
manner, employs a reflective form in <i>-sya</i> instead of the
passive, just as does the French; thus, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tavárni prodáutsya,
les hardes se vendent</i>, ‘The goods are sold,’ lit.
‘sell themselves:’ cf. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rien ne s’y voyait plus, pas même
des débris</i> (De Vigny).<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> ‘Nothing more was to be
seen, not even the ruined remains.’</p>

<p>In these cases, one element of the signification of
the middle voice is discarded. The middle voice
denotes that an action starts from a person, and
returns to him. In <i>I strike myself</i> the action ‘<i>strikes</i>’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
starts from the speaker, but visits him again with its
effects; in <i>I am struck</i> the action is visited upon the
subject, but does not originate therewith. There are
some reflective combinations, even in English, where
the consciousness of the activity of the subject has
practically disappeared: as in <i>How do you find yourself?
I bethought me; He found himself in an awkward
position</i>: but these, it will be seen, approach more to
the use of the simple intransitive, by means of the
relationship which this bears to the passive; cf.
<i>s’exciter</i> with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être excité</i>; ‘to be excited:’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moveri</i>,
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se movere</i>, ‘to move.’ There are certain uses of
the verb, in French and German, in which the operation
of the subject is almost effaced: as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sich befinden</i>,

<span class="medium">DISPLACEMENT OF THE SYNTACTICAL DISTRIBUTION.</span></h2>

<p>The reader who remembers and fully apprehends the
wider meaning, which in Chapter VI. we assigned to
the terms (Psychological) ‘subject’ and ‘predicate,’
must realise how comparatively seldom the grammatical
categories of the same name coincide with
the corresponding parts of the thought to which the
sentence is to give utterance. We defined the subject
as the expression for that which the speaker presupposes
known to the hearer, and the predicate as
that which indicates what he wishes the hearer to
think or learn about it. Hence, as we saw, the
sentence theoretically consists of two parts; but, as
each of these parts may be extended, we get&mdash;if we
indicate subject and predicate by the letters <i>S</i> and <i>P</i>
respectively, and the extensions by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc.&mdash;the
following scheme for a simple sentence: <i>Sabc</i> + <i>Pdef</i>.</p>

<p>Now, in such a sentence, the grammatical subject,
with all its extensions, will correspond with the psychological
subject, and the grammatical predicate and its
extensions with the psychological predicate, <i>only in
case</i> the extensions of the subject are really no more
than additions made in order to specify the <i>known</i> or
<i>presupposed</i>, and if the predicate contains nothing
which serves any further purpose than to convey the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
thought about that subject. But as soon as to the
subject-noun, for instance, an adjective is added which
conveys <i>new</i> thought about the subject; or, again, as
soon as the object is indicated by a noun accompanied
by a similar ‘additional’ qualification, then these
additions or extensions become <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> psychological
predicates, and the sentence, grammatically
simple, becomes a psychologically complex one.
Thus, suppose a good Charles and a wicked Charles
have been spoken of, and the latter is known to have
done something with his thick stick to the speaker;
then, and then only, can a sentence like <i>The wicked
Charles has beaten me with his thick stick</i> be a psychologically
simple one. In this sentence then, <i>The wicked
Charles</i> is subject, <i>has beaten</i> is predicate, and <i>with his
stick</i> extension, and the psychological and grammatical
divisions coincide completely. But suppose
that it was known that the same person had beaten
the speaker, but that the instrument was not known;
or that the action and the instrument were known,
but not the recipient of the blows: in this case the
sentence, though remaining a simple one, would at
once cease to correspond in its grammatical parts to
the psychological divisions of (<i>a</i>) <i>Charles has beaten me</i>
(subject) + <i>with his stick</i> (predicate), or, (<i>b</i>) <i>Charles
has beaten with his stick</i> (subject) + <i>me</i> (predicate).
In fact, if we wished to make the grammatical form
correspond to the divisions of that psychologically
simple statement, we should have to adopt a form
grammatically complex; such as <i>The instrument with
which Charles has beaten me is his thick stick</i>, or, <i>The
person whom Charles has beaten with his thick stick is
I</i>, according to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>In any of the cases enumerated above, the psychological
subject and predicate were simple. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
suppose that the hearer was not aware that anything
had happened, nor could be supposed to have any predisposition
to call the individual in question ‘wicked.’
Then, though the sentence remains grammatically a
simple one, we really get the following complex
<small>PSYCHOLOGICAL</small> <span class="nowrap">analysis:&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Subject: <i>Charles</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">Predicate: <i>is (in my opinion) wicked</i>.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. Subject: <i>The wicked Charles</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">Predicate: <i>has beaten</i>.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. Subject: <i>The object of that beating</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">Predicate (with copula): <i>is I</i>.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4. Subject: <i>The instrument with which that beating was inflicted upon me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">Predicate (with copula): <i>is a stick</i>.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">5. Subject: <i>That stick</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">Predicate (with copula): <i>is thick</i>.<br /></span>
</span></span>

While, therefore, the scheme could grammatically be
symbolised <i>aS</i> + <i>Pbc</i>, we should have to symbolise
the psychological analysis somewhat as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>P</i> + <i>S</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">{____}<br /></span>
<span class="i3"><i>S´</i> + <i>P´</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3">{_____}<br /></span>
<span class="i7"><i>S´´</i> + <i>P´´</i><br /></span>
<span class="i7">{______}<br /></span>
<span class="i12"><i>S´´´</i> + <i>P´´´</i><br /></span>
<span class="i12">{_______}<br /></span>
<span class="i18"><i>S´´´´</i> + <i>P´´´´</i><br /></span>
<span class="i18">{_______}<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At first sight this may seem far-fetched and uselessly
refined, but the student will find that it is
desirable to force himself in some such manner to fully
realise the absolute inadequacy of our grammatical
terms and distinctions when we apply them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
psychological questions: and to realise, also, the
vagueness with which long habit has taught us to be
satisfied in our modes of expression, and in our constructions
for various thoughts, differing essentially,
though perhaps not always widely.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> It is the full
conception of the somewhat haphazard nature of our
constructions which will help us to understand how
uncertain and how different in various speakers must,
on the one hand, be the correspondence between the
grammatical and psychological subject and predicate;
and, on the other, how vague must often be the distinctions
between the parts of our sentences, and how
varying the grouping of these parts, as we more or
less consciously conceive of them as connected or
as ‘belonging together.’ All is here fluctuating and
indefinite. Thus, as a rule, the word <i>is</i> in sentences
like <i>He is king</i>, <i>He is subject</i>, is mere copula, and <i>king</i>
the real predicate; though, when we utter the same
words in order to state that <i>he</i> and no one else occupies
the throne, <i>he</i> becomes psychologically predicate, and
<i>king</i>, or rather <i>is king</i>, becomes subject, whatever the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
grammatical form of the sentence may seem to prove
to the contrary. Again, in <i>He</i> <small>IS</small> <i>king</i> (<i>i.e.</i> now, and
not only going to be so), <i>he as king</i> is subject, <i>is (now)</i>
predicate.</p>

<p>Psychologically, the idea of the copula as mere link
between subject and predicate is far more extensive
than ordinary grammar admits. Thus, in <i>What is the
matter with him?</i> <i>He has got the toothache</i>, the predicate
of the latter sentence is <i>the toothache</i>, <i>has got</i> is
copula.</p>

<p>In <i>Will he be quick, do you think? Oh yes, he was
running very quickly</i>, the words <i>was running</i> are a
mere copula, unless, emphasised by stress of accent,
they are made to convey the specially desired statement
that the person spoken of <i>ran</i>, and did not walk
slowly or ride, etc., in which case they are a true
predicate.</p>

<p>We have here illustrated how one of the means for
distinguishing the predicate from the other parts of the
sentence is found in <i>accent</i> or <i>stress</i>.</p>

<p>But we do not invariably thus emphasise our predicate.
An interrogative pronoun, for instance, is
always a psychological predicate. If we ask <i>Who
has done this?</i> we usually lay our stress on <i>done</i> or on
<i>this</i>, though these words, being mere expressions for
the observed and known fact, contain the psychological
subject, and the unknown person indicated by <i>who</i> is
the predicate sought for by the questioner.</p>

<p>There exist other elements of speech which are
regularly subjects or predicates; for instance, a
demonstrative referring back to a substantive previously
expressed and commencing a sentence, is
necessarily a psychological subject, or part of it: <i>I
know those men are my enemies: them I despise</i>. A
relative pronoun, of course, has the same function:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
<i>there is a man whom I respect highly</i>. Again, every
element of a sentence whose connection with the rest
is denied by means of a negative particle is generally
a psychological predicate; as, <i>Yield not me the praise</i>
(Tennyson) = ‘The person to whom praise is due is
not I.’ <i>But not to me returns day</i> (Milton, Par. Lost,
iii. 41) = ‘Day returns to many, but among those
is<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> not I.’</p>

<p>This, of course, includes any words expressing the
contrast with the negatived element: <i>Give not me but
him the praise</i> = ‘The person to whom praise is due
is not I, (but) he.’</p>

<p>Besides emphasis, we have, in so-called inverted
constructions, the means of characterising any part of
a sentence as subject or predicate. Thus: <i>One thing
thou lackest</i> (Mark x. 21) = ‘One thing there is which
thou hast not.’ ‘<i>No pause of dread Lord William
knew</i>’ (Scott, Harold, v. 15) = ‘Not a pause of dread
existed which Lord William knew’ = ‘Not a pause
of dread was made by Lord William.’</p>

<p>A means of establishing correspondence between
the grammatical and psychological predicate has been
incidentally illustrated in the foregoing discussion. It
is the periphrastic construction with <i>is</i>, of which
instances are very numerous. <i>It is to you, young
people, that I speak</i>; <i>What I most prize in woman, is
her affections, not her intellect</i> (Longfellow); <i>It is thou
that robbest me of my Lord</i> (Shakespeare, 2 Hen. VI.,
IV. ii.); <i>It was not you that sent me hither, but God</i>
(Gen. xlv. 8).</p>

<p>This construction is quite common in many other
languages: French&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est a vous que je m’adresse</i>
(= ‘It is to you that I myself address’); German&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christen
sind es, die das getan haben</i> (lit. ‘Christians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
are it, that that done have’ = ‘It is (the) Christians
that have done this’).</p>

<p>In English, another construction often serves the
same purpose: <i>As to denying, he would scorn it</i>; <i>As
for that fellow, we’ll see about him to-morrow</i>. Or
(with the psychological subject simply in the nominative,
without any verbal indication of its connection
with what follows), <i>Husband and children, she saw them
murdered before her very eyes</i>; <i>My life’s foul deed, my
life’s fair end shall free it</i> (Shakespeare, Rape of Lucr.);
<i>The prince ... they will slay him</i> (Ben Jonson, Sejanus,
III. iii.); <i>That thing, I took it for a man</i> (Lear, IV. vi.
77). <i>Antipholus, my husband ... this ill day a most
outrageous fit of madness took him</i> (Com. of Errors, V. i.
138). When, in this construction, the words which
head the sentence stand for the same thing as the
subject pronoun of the following clause, the result, of
course, is not a readjustment of the parts, but an (often
useless) emphasis: cf. <i>John, he said so</i>; <i>The king, he
went</i>, etc. When the psychological subject would, in
the simpler constructions appear as a genitive, this is
indicated by the pronoun standing, in that case, e.g.,
<i>’Tis certain every man that dies ill, the ill is upon his
head</i> (Henry V., IV. i. 197). <i>That they who brought
me in my master’s hate, I live to look upon their tragedy</i>
(Rich. III., III. ii. 57); <i>And vows so born, in their
nativity all truth appears</i> (Mid. Night’s Dream, III.
ii. 124).</p>

<p>In Chapter VI. we have discussed the point that in
reality an adjective is psychologically a predicate: an
expression like <i>The good man</i> containing, in fact, a
statement that the man is good. There is a construction,
however,&mdash;and one, too, not unfrequent,&mdash;in which
the adjective contains the psychological and logical
subjects; e.g., <i>The short time at my disposal prevented</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
<i>me from calling upon him</i>&mdash;‘The shortness of the time
prevented,’ etc. Though this construction may perhaps
be due to a contamination between, say, <i>The shortness
of the time prevented</i> and <i>The short time did not allow</i>,
it still remains certain that in the construction, as it
stands, a displacement has occurred.</p>

<p>It might <i>a priori</i> be expected that all this uncertainty
and vagueness would cause parts of a sentence
which grammatically belong together to cohere but
loosely, and eventually to get separated, whilst other
grammatical connections, which at first did not exist,
would thereby arise. It is clear, for instance, that in
the sentence <i>I sit on a chair</i>, the preposition <i>on</i> is as
closely connected with the verb <i>to sit</i> as with the noun
<i>a chair</i>. Nay, it may be said that the ties which
connect it with the noun in this and similar cases must
once have been, and perhaps in the linguistic consciousness
of some speakers still are, stronger than
those between the preposition and the verb. This
would appear from the fact that the various prepositions
used to govern in English&mdash;as they still do in
German, for instance&mdash;various cases, while these ties
would be strengthened by the common occurrence of
the preposition with a noun, unaccompanied by any
verb; e.g., <i>That book there on the chair</i>; <i>The man in
the garden</i>, etc. It is, however, evident in many constructions
that the noun has separated from the preposition,
and that the latter has entered into closer
connection with the verb. We owe to this, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Latin and German ‘compound verbs,’ as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excedere</i>, ‘to
go out from,’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">anliegen</i>, ‘to be incumbent on,’ etc., which
used to govern, or still do govern the case which would
have followed the preposition if used immediately
before the noun and detached from the verb. In
English, this or a similar displacement has given rise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
to such constructions as <i>And this rich fair town we
make him lord of</i> (K. John, II. i. 553); <i>a place which
we have long heard of</i>; <i>Washes of all kinds I had an
antipathy to</i> (Goldsmith); <i>Logic I made no account of</i>
(Smollett, Rod. Random, 6); <i>This house I no more
show my face in</i> (She stoops to conquer, IV.); <i>The
false paiens stood he by</i> (P. Langtoft).</p>

<p>A careful study of the above examples will show
that in these and several of the following, the construction
has the effect and is most likely due to a desire of
bringing the psychological subject to the head of the
sentence. It is at present chiefly employed in relative
and interrogative clauses, and in sentences in the
passive voice: <i>The intended fire your city is ready to
flame in</i> (Coriolanus, V. 2); <i>An idle dare-devil of a
boy, whom his friends had been glad to get rid of</i> (Green,
Short History, p. 732); <i>Stories of the lady, which he
swore to the truth of</i> (Tom Jones, bk. xv., ch. 9);
<i>He was such a lover, as a generous friend of the lady
should not betray her to</i> (ibid., xiii. 2); <i>A pipe in his
mouth, which, indeed, he seldom was without</i> (ibid., ii.
2): <i>The eclipse which the nominal seat of Christianity
was under</i> (Earle, Anglo-Saxon Liter., p. 25); <i>Such
scruple of conscience as the terrors of their late invented
religion had let them into</i> (Puttenham, Arte of Poesie,
Arber’s reprint, p. 24); <i>An outrage confessed to on a
death-bed</i> (Liv. Daily Post, Aug. 1, 1884, p. 5, col. a.);
<i>He was seldom talked of</i>, etc. <i>What humour is the
prince of?</i> (Hen. IV., II. iv).<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>In the sentence <i>I will never allow you to read this
book</i>, there is no doubt that every speaker feels <i>this
book</i> as object of <i>read</i>, and <i>read this book</i> as object of
<i>allow</i>. If, however, in order to make <i>this book</i> if it is
psychological subject, appear also as the grammatical
subject, we say <i>This book I shall never allow you to
read</i>, we can very well understand how a speaker’s
linguistic sense may come to connect <i>this book</i> directly
as object with the entire group <i>allow to read</i>, nay
more, with the verb <i>allow</i>; as if it stood for <i>I will
never allow you this book to read</i>. This may arise all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the more easily that, in a clause like <i>I have to read
this book</i>, the words <i>this book</i> are historically the object
of <i>have</i> and not of the infinitive <i>to read</i>, and that,
in the form <i>this book I have to read</i>, the noun is in
close proximity to its historical government <i>I have</i>.
Hence, such transference of government from the infinitive
to the group <i>finite verb</i> + <i>infinitive</i> and finally
to the <i>finite verb</i> has occasionally really taken place,
as can be shown by the way in which such clauses
have sometimes been turned into the passive voice.
A sentence like <i>The judge allowed them to drop the
prosecution</i> can, strictly speaking, be turned into the
passive only in one or other of the following ways:
<i>They were allowed to drop the prosecution</i>, or, <i>The
judge allowed that the prosecution should be dropped</i>;
in each of which cases, the object of the verb has
become the subject of the same verb in the passive
voice. If, however, aided by such constructions as
<i>The prosecution which the judge allowed them to drop</i>,
the object (<i>prosecution</i>) of the verb <i>to drop</i> becomes,
first, object of the syntactical combination <i>allow to
drop</i>, and, finally, in the illogical thinker’s consciousness
or linguistic sense, object of the verb <i>to allow</i>,&mdash;there
may arise a passive construction something like
the following: <i>The prosecution which was allowed to be
dropped</i>. This construction is indeed incorrect in
English, but its parallel may be occasionally heard
from careless speakers, and a careful study of it will
illustrate and make intelligible such phrases as the
German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hier ist sie zu spielen verboten</i>, literally =
‘Here is she (<i>i.e.</i>, Minna <i>v.</i> Barnhelm, <i>i.e.</i>, the play of
that name) to play forbidden’ = ‘Here it has been forbidden
to play her (<i>sc.</i> it),’ as passive of ‘They have
forbidden to play it here;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die stellung des fürsten
Hohenlohe wird zu untergraben versucht</i> = ‘The position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
of the Prince Hohenlohe is to undermine attempted’
= ‘An attempt is being made to undermine the position,
etc.;’ or again, the Greek χιλίων δράχμων ἀπορρηθεισῶν
λαβεῖν (Demosthenes), lit. ‘One thousand
drachms having been agreed to receive’ = ‘It having
been agreed that I should receive one thousand
drachms.’ Similarly, the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Librum legere cœpi</i> =
(‘I begin to read the book’) is turned into the
passive, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber legi cœptus est</i> = (‘The book to be read
has been begun’), the perfect parallel of our somewhat
fictitious English example.</p>

<p>In our examples, ‘He has got the toothache,’
etc., we saw that the grammatical predicate often
has, in reality, no other psychological function than
that of mere copula, or, as it is often called, connecting
word. The regular and constant use of
certain words in that manner has led some grammarians
to group these together as a separate grammatical
category, a grouping or distinction to which
many others vigorously object. The view which one
takes in this question is mainly influenced by (<i>a</i>) what
we call a ‘connecting word,’ and (<i>b</i>) a clear distinction
between the grammatical form and the function of a
word. Now, a connecting word is a word which
serves to indicate the connection between two ideas
or conceptions, and which accordingly can neither
stand alone, nor have any definite sense if placed with
only one such conception. Such a connecting word
between subject and predicate we have in the verb
<i>to be</i>, the copula, in most of its uses. It is said by
some that the word <i>is</i> never has any other function
than that of true predicate, and that the predicatival
adjective or noun is always to be considered a determinant
of the predicate. This, whilst true as to grammatical
<i>form</i>, is certainly incorrect as to <i>function</i>. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the first place, we have already discussed (Chap. VI.)
how sentences like <i>Borrowing is sorrowing</i>, contains
no less, but also no more than <i>Borrow sorrow</i>, in
which the latter word contains the true psychologic
predicate. Further, if we were to attribute to the
word <i>is</i> in such sentences the same force as, for
instance, in <i>God is</i>, i.e., <i>God exists</i>, we should necessarily
have to explain a sentence, <i>This is impossible</i>,
as ‘This exists as something impossible;’ which
every one will at once perceive to be nonsense.</p>

<p>We must recognise in sentences like <i>Borrow sorrow</i>
an original construction, by the side of which there
sooner or later arose clauses truly denoting existence,
such as <i>God is</i>, or even <i>God is good</i>, in which, at first,
<i>is</i> had its full meaning of <i>exists</i>, and <i>good</i> had consequently
such the function of an adverb. When once,
in the latter and similar sentences, a displacement and
redistribution of the function began to take place, and
the adjective <i>good</i> (or, <i>e.g.</i>, the noun <i>king</i> in <i>He is king</i>)
acquired the force of a true logical predicate, the
fuller construction with the copula <i>is</i> more and more
frequently ousted the shorter one, which had no such
link between subject and predicate. The reluctance
of some grammarians to admit this is perhaps partially
due, also, to the fact that the copula has always retained
the full inflectional forms of a true predicatival
verb. Hence they did not so easily realise the displacement
which had occurred&mdash;a displacement which,
in other sentences, where the part thereby affected is
flectionless, is easier to demonstrate.</p>

<p>We shall first discuss one more instance of how a
displacement affects inflected parts of speech, and then
one or two in which the words concerned have no longer
any inflection to connect them with other forms, and to
protect them from isolation and change of function.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>In the sentences <i>I make him</i> and <i>I make a king</i>, we
have two accusatives of slightly different functions:
the one indicating the <small>OBJECT</small> of the action (<i>him</i>), and
the other indicating the <small>RESULT</small> of the action (<i>a king</i>).
If the two statements be now combined, then, applied
as they are to convey to the hearer the two distinct
pieces of information as to the object and as to the
results of the action, both of which were previously
unknown to him, we have undoubtedly one verb with
two distinct and equipoised accusatives. But assuming
that either the object of the action or the result is
already known, it is then only the other member of
the pair which has the full predicatival force, whilst
the former inevitably enters into a closer relationship
with the verb. The member which retains the full
force of a predicate becomes predicate to the group;
nay, even&mdash;as in our example, where the verb cannot
be taken in its literal meaning&mdash;the one noun becomes
almost a predicate to the other, <i>I make him king</i>
being very similar in meaning to <i>He becomes king
through my agency</i>. If this is the correct explanation
of the origin of similar constructions, we must perhaps
consider the use of an adjective as second accusative
as due to analogy with this use of the noun. We
must not forget, however, that the line of demarcation
between adjective and noun was once very much more
vague and indefinite than it is now.</p>

<p>In a similar way, the sentence <i>I teach him to speak
and I declare him to be an honest man</i> must be a combination,
with consequent displacement of relation, of
two independent clauses&mdash;the one with a noun, or the
equivalent thereof, and the other with an infinite as
object. It is thus we explain the origin of the Latin
accusative with infinitive.</p>

<p>An example of displacement, or re-arrangement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
relations, is next furnished by the origin and history
of our correlatives <i>either</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>both</i>, <i>and</i>. <i>Either</i> means
originally (A.S. <i>ægðer</i>, contracted from <i>æghwæðer</i> = <i>á</i>
+ <i>ge</i> + <i>hwæðer</i>) <i>one of two</i>, so that <i>either he or you</i> is
really = <i>one of the two</i>; <i>you or he</i>, where the word
<i>either</i>, as it were, sums up or comprehends the whole
of the following enumeration. It stands, therefore, in
syntactical relation to both the members of the clause
which are connected (or contrasted) by <i>or</i>; but is
now usually felt as connected with the first only, the
sentence being divided as <i>either he</i> + <i>or you</i>. Similarly,
<i>both</i> means <i>two together</i>. Hence <i>both you and I</i>
originally had the full force of <i>the two together</i>, i.e., <i>you
and I</i>. The word which stood in syntactical relation
with the pair has therefore, as in the former case,
become co-ordinate with the word <i>and</i>, which once
formed part of the group it governed, and we now
feel and explain expressions like our examples as
consisting of the two groups, <i>both you</i> + <i>and I</i>.</p>

<p>In the last two examples the words are now
flectionless, and have become, when used in such
constructions, connecting words, a change entirely
owing to such displacement of relationship between
the parts of the sentence as we have been studying in
this chapter.</p>

<p>In the discussion of our example on page 270 we
noticed how even a grammatically simple clause might
in reality be a logically complex one. <i>Vice versâ</i>, a
clause logically simple may be expressed by a grammatically
complex sentence. <i>I asked him after his
health</i>, as an answer to <i>What were you asking him?</i> is
a psychologically and grammatically simple sentence.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
The answer might, however, without in the least
degree altering the thought expressed, have been cast
in the form <i>I asked him how he was</i>&mdash;a grammatically
complex sentence.</p>

<p>Again, logical independence and grammatical co-ordination
do not by any means necessarily go
together&mdash;a sentence like <i>He first went to Paris,
whence he proceeded to Rome, where he met his friend</i>
being in form complex with main and subordinate
clauses; in meaning, however, equivalent to an aggregate
of three co-ordinate ‘main’ clauses: <i>He went</i> +
<i>from there he proceeded</i> + <i>there he met</i>.</p>

<p>Nay, it occasionally happens that syntactical form
and logical function are in direct opposition. Thus,
<i>e.g.</i>, in <i>Scarcely had he entered the house, when his
mother exclaimed, There is John!</i> what is logically the
main clause has the grammatical or syntactical form
of a subordinate one.</p>

<p>It cannot now, therefore, seem strange that in
syntax we also meet with the parallel of the process
which gave birth to such words as <i>adder</i>, <i>orange</i>, <i>newt</i>,
and <i>nickname</i>. <i>Adder</i>, cf. Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">natter</i>, Icelandic <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">naðr</i>,
was in Anglo-Saxon <i>nædre</i>. Similarly, <i>orange</i>, derived
from the Persian <i lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">nâranj</i>, was originally preceded by
an <i>n</i>. In the combination with the indefinite article <i>a</i>
or <i>an</i> (the older form) this <i>n</i> was thought to belong to
the article only, and the sound-groups <i>anorange</i>,
<i>anadder</i> were wrongly split up into <i>an</i> + <i>orange</i>, <i>an</i> +
<i>adder</i>. On the other hand, the groups <i>anekename</i>
(really <i>an</i> + <i>ekename</i>) and <i>anewt</i> (really <i>an</i> + <i>ewt</i>) were
erroneously broken up into <i>a</i> + <i>newt</i>, <i>a</i> + <i>nickname</i>.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>A precisely similar occurrence in syntax has given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
us our conjunction <i>that</i>. <i>I know that</i> (= ‘I know this
thing’) + <i>he can sing</i>, when combined into the group of
subject <i>I</i>, predicate <i>know</i>, object (double, the one part
being explanatory of the other) <i>that</i> and <i>he can sing</i>,
gradually became divided, or divisible for the linguistic
consciousness, into <i>I know</i> + <i>he can sing</i>, with
the conjunction <i>that</i> for connecting word.</p>

<p>In some cases the correspondence between psychological
and grammatical distribution is so incomplete,
the subordinate and main clauses are so interwoven in
the grammatical form, that it becomes impossible to
separate the parts in our ordinary analysis. This
happens more especially when a part of the grammatically
subordinate clause really contains the psychological
subject, and when, consequently, that part, with
a construction similar to that discussed on page 274 is
put at the head of the clause. When, in the sentence
<i>I believe that something will make you smile</i>, the word
<i>something</i> expressed the psychological subject, Goldsmith
emphasised this fact by writing, <i>Something, that
I believe will make you smile</i>; cf. Milton’s <i>Whereof I
gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat</i>; <i>With me I see
not who partakes</i>, etc. This arrangement, then, places
the main clause between parts of what is grammatically
the subordinate one. In not a few cases confusion
or uncertainty may, then, arise as to whether the
words which head the sentence must be considered as
belonging to the subordinate clause or as governed by
the verb of the main clause. If we say <i>The place
which he knew that he could not obtain</i>, we may hesitate
as to whether <i>place</i> is really object to <i>knew</i> or to
<i>obtain</i>. We can, and often do, avoid this ambiguity
and intermixture of main and subordinate clauses by
a kind of double construction, like <i>The place, of which
he knew that he could not obtain it</i>.

<span class="medium">ON CONCORD.</span></h2>

<p>In inflectional languages, words relating to the same
thing in the same way are commonly made to
correspond formally with each other. This correspondence
we call grammatical concord. Thus we find
concord in gender, number, case, and person subsisting
between a substantive and its predicate or attribute,
or between a substantive and a pronoun or adjective
representing the latter. Similarly we find a correspondence
in tense and mood within the same period,
or complex of sentences. This concord can hardly be
said to be the necessary result of the logical relation
of the words; the English collocation, <i>the good father’s
child</i>, where no formal concord is established between
‘the good’ and ‘father’s,’ seems as logical as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">des
guten vater’s kind</i>, where the article and the adjective
have their respective genitive forms as well as the
noun. Concord seems to have taken its origin from
cases in which the formal correspondence of two words
with each other came about, not owing to the relation
borne by the former to the latter, but merely to the
identity of their relation to some other word. Thus
we should have an example of primitive concord in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fratris puer boni</i>, if felt by the speaker’s linguistic
consciousness something like <i>of (my) brother (the)</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
<i>child of (the) good (one)</i>, i.e., <i>the child of (my) brother,
the good</i>, i.e., <i>the child of (my) good brother</i>.</p>

<p>After such correspondence began to be regularly
conceived of as concord, <i>i.e.</i>, as a habit natural to
language, we must suppose that, owing to the operation
of analogy, it extended its area to other cases to which
it did not logically belong. We shall be confirmed
in our theory that such was the procedure, if we
examine certain cases in which the extension of concord
can still be historically followed.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us take such a case as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce sont
mes frères</i>. In English we translate this by <i>Those are
my brothers</i>. The subject, however, in this case
merely directs attention to something unknown until
the predicate states what has to be known: the English
pronoun, therefore, should strictly speaking stand
in the neuter singular, as, indeed, it habitually did in
A.S. <i>ðæt sindon</i>, etc., and as it does in Modern
German to the present day&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das sind meine brüder</i>.
Even in Modern English we have cases like <i>It is we
who have won</i>; <i>’Twas men I lacked</i>; <i>Is it only the
plebeians who will rise?</i> (Bulwer, Rienzi, i. 5); but
commonly, in Modern English and elsewhere, it
appears brought into concord with the predicate, as
<i>These are thy glorious works</i> (Milton): in Italian&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">È
questa la vostra figlia?</i> = ‘Is this (fem.) your
daughter?’ Spanish&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Esta es la espada</i> = ‘This (fem.)
is the sword’ (fem.): in Greek&mdash;Αὕτη  τοι δίκη ἐστι
θεῶν (Homer) = ‘This (fem.), then, is the judgment
(fem.) of the gods:’ and in Latin this use is extremely
common; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eas divitias, eam bonam famam, magnamque
nobilitatem, putabant</i> (Sall., Cat., 7),<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> = ‘These (fem.
plur.) they considered riches (fem. plur.), this (fem.
sing.) a good name (fem.), and great nobility (fem.);’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
<i>i.e.</i>, ‘This they looked upon as true riches; by such
means they strove for fame; that was what they
thought conferred true rank:’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patres C. Mucio agrum
dono dedere quæ postea sunt Mucia prata appellata</i>
(Livy, ii. 13) = ‘The fathers (senate) gave to C.
Mucius <i>a field</i> as a present which (neut. plur.) afterwards
<i>were</i> called the Mucian fields (neut. plur.).’</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find instances like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sabini
spem in discordia Romana ponunt: eam impedimentum
delectui fore</i> (Livy, iii. 38) = ‘The Sabines base
their expectations on the domestic quarrels of the
Romans; (they hoped) that <i>this</i> (fem. sing. agreeing
with <i>spem</i>) would be a preventative (neut. sing.):
and so <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si hoc profectio est</i> (Livy, ii. 38) = If this
(neut.) is a setting-out (fem.).’ It seems that, in the
former cases, the subject has been made to agree with
the predicate just as the predicate in other cases conforms
to the subject.</p>

<p>We sometimes find, in Latin, words which
commonly occur in the singular only, placed in the
plural when connected with words used in the plural
only; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summis opibus atque industriis</i> (Plautus,
Mostellaria, 348) = ‘with the greatest means (exertions)
and <i>zeals</i> (for <i>zeal</i>):’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neque vigiliis neque
quietibus</i> (Sallust, Cat., 15) = ‘neither during watchings
nor during <i>rests</i> (for <i>rest</i>):’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paupertates</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divitiæ</i>
(Varro,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Apud Non.) = ‘<i>poverties</i> (for <i>poverty</i>)&mdash;riches.’
Similarly, we find <i>She is my goods, my chattels</i> (Shakespeare,
Tam. of Shrew, III. ii.), where the singular
would be the natural form for <i>chattel</i>; but <i>good</i> in the
singular would have a different meaning from <i>goods</i>,
and <i>chattels</i> is made to conform to <i>goods</i>.</p>

<p>The so-called predicatival dative in Latin seems to
have started from cases like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quibus hoc impedimento
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
erat</i> = ‘to whom this was for a hindrance:’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mihi
gaudio fuit</i> = ‘It was for a joy to me:’ etc.</p>

<p>It was felt that the ordinary predicate was put in
the same case as its subject, and the concord was
analogically extended to the dative. Thus Cicero
(Dom., 3) writes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illis incuria inimicorum probro non
fuit</i> = ‘To them (dat.) the negligence of their enemies
was not <i>(for a) reproach</i>’ (dat.), <i>i.e.</i>, ‘was no reproach,’ as
contrasted with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum scelus meum probrum esse</i> = ‘that
your wickedness (acc.) should be my reproach (acc.).’</p>

<p>In a sentence like <i>They call him John</i> the name
<i>John</i> ought strictly speaking to have no case; the
simple stem should stand: and we might even expect
the vocative to occur after verbs of naming, as it
actually does sometimes in Greek; as, Τί με καλεῖτε
κύριε; (Luke vi. 46), translated, in the Vulgate, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid
vocatis me domine?</i><a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> and in the authorised version,
<i>Why call ye me lord, lord?</i> Thus in Latin, too:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clamassent ut litus Hyla, Hyla, omne sonaret</i> (Vergil,
Eclogue vi. 43), ‘They were shouting so that the
whole shore was echoing Hylas! Hylas!’ (voc.);
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Matutine pater seu Jane libentius audis</i> (Hor.,
Sat. II., vi. 10), ‘O Father Matutinus, or Janus, if thou
givest readier ear thus addressed.’ But the most
common usage at the present day is the accusative;
which is already found at least once in the few
remnants of Gothic literature which we possess: in
Luke iv. 13, we read: <i>Jah gavaljands us im tvalib,
ðanzei jah apaustuluns namnida</i> = ‘and choosing out
(from) them twelve whom also apostles (acc. plur.) (he)
named.’ This accusative seems to be an analogical
transference from such cases as the common construction,
<i>Izei ðiudan sik silban taujið</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui regem se
facit</i> = <i>Who king himself makes</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>In cases like <i>He bears the name John</i>, the pure
stem, or the nominative which most nearly represents
it, should stand; as it does in the instance given. In
English, we often use phrases like ‘the name of John,’
after the analogy of ‘the city of Rome,’ etc. In
Latin, we find merely exceptionally such cases as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lactea nomen habet</i> (Ovid, Metam., i. 168) = ‘It (the
Milky Way) has the name milky,’ where <i>milky</i> is
nominative. In classical Latin, concord is observed
by placing the nominative side by side with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>
when this word stands in the nominative; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui
nomen Arethusa est</i> (Cicero, Verr., iv. 53) = ‘Whose
name is Arethusa;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ei morbo nomen est avaritia</i>
(Cicero, Tusc. Disp., iv. 11) = ‘To that malady the
name is avarice.’ But we not uncommonly find in
Latin that, while the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i> is in the nominative,
the name itself is made to agree with the noun or
pronoun expressing the person who bears it; as,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomen Mercurio est mihi</i> (Plautus, Amph., Prol. 19)
= ‘The name is Mercury (dat.) to me (dat.),’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘My
name is Mercury;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puero ab inopia Egerio inditum
nomen</i> (Livy, i. 34) = ‘To the boy (dat.) from his
poverty Egerius (dat.) was given the name,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘The
name of Egerius was given to the boy from his
poverty.’ Nay, we find a similar vacillation in concord
where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i> is in the accusative case; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Filiis
duobus Philippum et Alexandrum et filiæ Apamam
nomina imposuerat</i> (Livy, xxxv. 47) = ‘To his two sons
he had given the names Philip and Alexander, and to
his daughter, Apama.’ In this sentence, we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>
in the accusative plural and the names <i>Philip</i>, etc., also
in the accusative, though singular; so that the latter
agree in case with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>, and not with the datives
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filiis duobus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filiæ</i>) of the persons bearing them.
In the following instance the reverse is the case: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Superbo cognomen facta indiderunt</i> (Livy, i. 49) = ‘To
whom (dat.) Superbus (dat.) the name (acc.) his deeds
have given,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘To whom his deeds have given the
name Superbus.’ This very vacillation proves that the
speakers recognised no logical necessity for employing
one case rather than another; but, in default of an
absolute stem, chose a case which seemed to tally with
some existing principle of concord already prevailing
in language.</p>

<p>A similar vacillation occurs in cases of the predicatival
noun or predicatival attributive with an
infinitive, as in <i>It suited him to remain unknown</i>.</p>

<p>In English no doubt could arise, as the adjectives
maintain an absolute form; but even in German,
where the adjectives when used as predicates have
different forms from those which they bear when used
as epithets, it is correct to say, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es steht dir frei als
verständiger mann zu handeln</i> = ‘It stands thee free
as sensible man to act,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘You are free to act as a
man of sense,’&mdash;in which case we find the declined
nominative ‘verständiger,’ used as it is whenever the
adjective is followed by a noun, and when, consequently,
according to the rules of German grammar,
the undeclined form cannot be employed.</p>

<p>In Latin the nominative stands if it can be connected
with the subject of the governing verb: as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater
esse disce</i> (‘Learn to be a father’); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omitto iratus esse</i>
(‘I cease to be angry’); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cupio esse victor</i> (‘I desire
to be victor’). In poetry we find expressions like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ait
fuisse navium celerrimus</i> (Catullus, iv. 2) = ‘Says that
it was the fastest of ships,’&mdash;a construction copied
by Milton in ‘And knew not eating death’ (Par. Lost,
ix. 792:) ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sensit medios delapsus in hostes</i>’ (Vergil,
Æn., ii. 377) = ‘He perceived that he had fallen into
the midst of enemies.’ In these cases, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celerrimus</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delapsus</i> are nominative, instead of the usual accusative;
and similarly, in Greek, we find the nominative
coupled with the infinitive used substantively, though
this may be in another case: as, Ὁπόθεν ποτὲ ταύτην τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἔλαβες τὸ μανικὸς καλεῖσθαι, οὐκ οἶδα ἔγωγε (Plato, Symp., 173 D), ‘Whence ever thou
didst take this name the-to-be-called <i>mad</i> (nom. sing.
masc.), I don’t know;’ Ὀρέγονται τοῦ πρῶτος εκαστος
γίγνεσθαι (Thucydides, ii. 65), ‘They wish for the (gen.)
first (nom.) each (nom.) to become (gen.),’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘They
all wish to become first.’ Nay, in Greek, it is possible
to connect with the infinitive even a genitive or
dative depending on the governing sentence; as in
Εὐδαίμοσιν ὑμῖν ἔξεστι γίγνεσθαι (Demosthenes, Dem.
iii. 23), ‘It is permitted <i>you</i> (dat.) to become <i>happy</i>
(dat.);’ Ἐδέοντο Κύρου ὡς προθυμοτάτου γενέσθαι
(Xenophon, Hell., I. v. 2), ‘They were begging <i>Cyrus</i>
(gen.) to show himself as <i>energetic-as-possible</i> (gen.).’</p>

<p>In Latin we find the connection with a dative,
though not so widely as in Greek: as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Animo otioso
esse impero</i> (Terence, Phorm., II. ii. 26) = ‘Mind (dat.)
easy (dat.) to be I command (myself&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dative understood</i>),’
<i>i.e.</i> ‘I order my mind to be at ease;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Da mihi
fallere, da justo sanctoque videri</i> (Hor., Ep. I. xvi. 61),
‘Grant me to deceive, grant <i>me</i> (dat.) to seem <i>just and
holy</i> (dat.);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vobis necesse est fortibus viris esse</i> (Livy,
xxi. 44), ‘It is necessary for you (dat.) to be brave
men (dat.);’ and commonly with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">licet</i> (‘it is allowed,’)
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in Republica mihi neglegenti esse non licet</i> (Cicero,
ad Att., i. 17), ‘In politics I dare not be indifferent.’<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
To take this last example, for instance, we have (1) the
governing sentence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non mihi licet</i> (‘It is not lawful
<i>for me</i>,’ dat.), (2) the infinitive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esse</i> (‘to be’), and (3)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
the dative (depending on the governing sentence, and
connected with the infinitive), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglegenti</i> (‘indifferent’).</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this customary
usage.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The accusative is sometimes found after <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">licet</i>, as
in the passage <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si civi Romano licet esse Gaditanum, etc.</i>,
‘If it is allowed a <i>Roman Citizen</i> (dat.) to be <i>a citizen
of Gades</i> (acc.).’ This use depends on the fact that the
accusative is the ordinary case of the subject with the
infinitive, e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Permitto civem Romanum esse Gaditanum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
‘I permit a <i>Roman Citizen</i> (acc.) to be <i>a citizen of Gades</i>
(acc.).’</p>

<p>There are, again, other cases in which no concord
is expressed; in which concord, indeed, is almost incapable
of being carried out. In these cases, in default
of the pure stem which&mdash;were it possible to employ it&mdash;would
be the only natural form to employ, the place
has been supplied by the nominative. In English, for
instance, we are familiar with such phrases as <i>My profession
as teacher</i>, <i>his position as advocate</i>. In Latin we
find such constructions as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sempronius causa ipse pro se
dicta damnatur</i> (Livy, iv. 44.), ‘Sempronius is condemned,
<i>his cause having been defended</i> (abl. abs.)
<i>himself</i> (nom.);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes in spem suam quisque acceptis
prœlium poscunt</i> (Livy, xxi. 45), ‘All they having
been accepted after their own hopes, each demand
battle’ (here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes</i> (‘all’) is nominative, while
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acceptis</i> (‘having been accepted’) is ablative absolute);
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flumen Albin transit longius penetrata Germania quam
quisquam priorum</i> (Tacitus, Annals, iv. 45), ‘He
crosses the river Elbe after penetrating Germany
further than any of his predecessors,’ lit. ‘Germany
having been penetrated (abl. abs.) further than any
(nom.) of his predecessors (<i>i.e.</i> had penetrated it).’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
In these cases, no doubt <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quisquam</i>, ‘himself’
and ‘any,’ depend, <i>grammatically</i> speaking, on the
subject of the finite verb, but they belong <i>logically</i> to
the ablative absolute only, with which they cannot be
brought into concord.</p>

<p>Variation of concord exists between two parts of
the same sentence in various languages, as in the
case of ‘What <i>is</i> six winters?’ (Shakespeare, Rich.
II., I. iii.), as against ‘What <i>are</i> six winters?’ ‘Such
<i>was</i> my orders,’ as against ‘Such <i>were</i> my orders;’
‘She <i>is</i> my goods;’<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> ‘What <i>means</i> these questions?’
(Young, Night Thoughts, iv. 398). Bacon (Advancement
of Learning, II. ii. 7) has ‘A portion of the
time wherein there <i>hath been</i> the greatest varieties.’
The original rule was that the copula, like every other
verb, followed the number of the subject, as in the
first-named instances; and as, again, in French, in
such cases as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est eux</i>, ‘It is they;’ <i>Il est cent usages</i>,
‘There is hundred usages;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’était les petites îles</i>, ‘It
was the little islands.’ In Latin, also, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nequam pax est
indutiæ</i> (A. Gellius), ‘A truce (lit. <i>truces</i>) is a bad
peace;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contentum rebus suis esse maximæ sunt divitiæ</i>
(Cicero, Pro. Ar., vi. 3), ‘To be content with one’s
circumstances are the greatest riches.’ In these cases
it is indifferent which substantive be considered the
logical subject.</p>

<p>In German, on the other hand, it is common, when
the predicate is plural, to put the copula in the same
number; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das sind zwei verschiedene dinge</i> = ‘That
are two different things.’ Other languages have corresponding
usages; thus, in Modern Greek, Ἔπρεπε νὰ
ἦναι τέσσαρα, ‘There behoves to be four.’ In Old
Greek we find Τὸ χωρίον τοῦτο, ὅπερ πρότερον Ἑννέα
ὁδοὶ εκαλοῦντο, ‘This spot which <i>were</i> before <i>called</i> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
nine ways’ (Thuc., iv. 102); and in French we find
such expressions as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce sont des bêtises</i>, ‘This are
stupidities.’ Even in English we find such phrases as
‘Their haunt <i>are</i> the deep gorges of the mountains.’<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
The usage seems due to the fact that the plural makes
itself more characteristically felt than the singular.
On the other hand, in several languages the converse
usage is possible; <i>i.e.</i> the copula in the singular stands
with a plural subject and before a singular predicate:
as, in Greek, Αἵ χορηγίαι ἱκανὸν εὐδαιμονίας σημεῖον
ἐστι, ‘The services is a sufficient token of prosperity:’
in Latin&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loca quæ Numidia appellatur</i> (Sallust),
‘Places which is called Numidia;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quas geritis vestes
sordida lana fuit</i> (Ovid, Ars Am., iii. 222), ‘The
clothes you wear was dirty wool:’ in English&mdash;<i>Two
paces in the vilest earth is room enough</i> (Shakespeare,
1 Hen. IV., V. iv. 91); <i>Forty yards is room enough</i>
(Sheridan, Rivals, v. 2). We also find the curious
instance of ‘Sham heroes, <i>what</i> are called quacks’
(Carlyle, Past and Present, ii. 7): in Spanish we have
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Los encamisados era gente medrosa</i>, ‘The highwaymen
(lit. ‘shirtclad’) was a cowardly lot’ (Cervantes).</p>

<p>Similarly, we find in the person of the verb a
corresponding usage: <i>It was you</i>; <i>Is that they?</i> in
French&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est moi</i> (‘It is I’); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est nous</i> (‘It is we’);
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est vous</i> (‘It is you’): in Old French it was possible
to say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est eux</i> (‘It is they’). On the other hand, in
Modern German we find such forms as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das waren sie</i>
(‘That were you’); <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sind sie das</i> (‘Are you that’):
and in Old French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce ne suis je pas</i> = ‘This no am I
(at-all);’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’estez vous</i> (‘This are you’); but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’ont été</i>
(‘This they have been’); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce furent les Phéniciens qui
inventèrent l’écriture</i> (Bossuet), ‘It were (3rd plur.) the
Phenicians who invented writing.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>In sentences beginning in English with <i>there</i>,
and in French with the (neut.) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il</i>, we find that commonly
in English the verb agrees in number with the
subject which follows it, whilst in French it agrees
with the pronoun <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il</i>, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est des gens de bien</i> (‘There
<i>is</i> good people’); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rarement il arrive des révolutions</i>
(‘Rarely there happens revolutions’). In English we
more commonly find the plural; cf. Mätzner, vol. ii.,
p. 106&mdash;<i>There were many found to deny it</i>: but we also
find <i>There is no more such Cæsars</i> (Shakespeare,
Cymb., III. i.).<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>A participle employed as a predicate or copula may
agree with the predicatival substantive instead of the
subject; as, Πάντα διήγησις οὖσα τυγχάνει (Plato, Rep.,
392 D), ‘Everything happens to be an explanation,’
where the part. οὖσα (lit. ‘being’) agrees with διήγησις
(‘explanation’); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paupertas mihi onus visum</i> (Terence,
Phorm., I. ii. 44), ‘Poverty (fem.) to me a burden (neut.)
seemed (neut. part.)’ = ‘Poverty seemed to me a
burden;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nisi honos ignominia putanda est</i> (Cicero, pro
Balb., 3), ‘Unless honour (masc.) is to be thought (fem.)
shame (fem.).’ On the other hand, we find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semiramis
puer esse credita est</i> (Justin, i. 2) = ‘Semiramis was
thought to be a boy,’ where the part. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credita</i> (‘thought’)
takes its gender from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semiramis</i>, and not from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puer</i>.</p>

<p>The predicate, again, which would naturally follow
the subject, may follow some apposition of the subject:
as, Θήβαι, πόλις ἀστυγέιτων, ἐκ μέσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος
ἀνήρπασται (Æschines v. Ctes., 133 ), ‘Thebes (plur.)
a neighbouring city, <i>is torn</i> from the centre of Greece;’
Latin&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corinthum totius Græciæ lumen extinctum esse
voluerunt</i> (Cicero, Leg. Man., 5), ‘Corinth (fem.), the
light of all Greece, they wished to be extinguished
(neut.).’ Again, though the subject is plural, we find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the verb agreeing with its distributival apposition, and
placed in the singular; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pictores et poetæ, suum
quisque opus a vulgo considerari vult</i> (Cic., de Offic., i.
41), ‘Painters and poets <i>each wishes</i> that his work
should be examined by the public.’</p>

<p>The construction is more striking still in which
the predicate is made to agree with a noun compared
with the subject (1) in gender&mdash;as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magis pedes quam
arma tuta sunt</i> (Sallust, Jugurtha, 74<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>) = ‘Feet (masc.)
are safer (neut.) than arms (neut.):’ (2) in number&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Me
non tantum literæ, quantum longinquitas temporis
mitigavit</i> (Cicero, Fam., vi. 4) = ‘Me not so much
<i>letters</i> as <i>length</i> of time <i>has</i> comforted:’ (3) in gender
and number&mdash;as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quand on est jeunes, riches, et jolies,
comme vous, mesdames, on n’en est pas réduites à l’artifice</i>
(Diderot), ‘When <i>one</i> (sing.) is <i>young, rich, and pretty</i>,
(fem. plur.) as you are, <i>ladies</i>, one (sing.) is not reduced
(fem. plur.) to artifice:’ (4) in person and number&mdash;as,
Ἡ τύχη ἀεὶ βέλτιον ἢ ἡμεὶς ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιμελούμεθα
(Demosthenes, Phil., I. 12), ‘Fortune always for us more
than <i>we care for</i> ourselves.’ In English we meet with
many sentences like ‘Sully bought of Monsieur de la
Roche Guzon one of the finest <i>horses</i> that <i>was</i> ever
seen.’ The concord of the predicate with a second
subject connected with the words <i>and not</i> is also
curious; as, <i>Heaven, and not we, have safely fought to-day</i>
(Shakespeare, 2 Hen. IV., IV. ii.).<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>In Greek, an apposition separated from the noun
by a relative sentence may follow the relative pronoun
in case; as, Κύκλωπος κεχόλωται, ὃν οφθάλμου ἀλάωσεν,
ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον (Hom., Od., i. 69), ‘He is wrath
with the <i>Cyclops</i> (gen.) <i>whom</i> (acc.) he deprived of an
eye, <i>the divine Polyphemus</i> (acc.).’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>A demonstrative or relative, instead of following
the substantive to which it refers, may follow a noun
predicated of it; as, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucade sunt hæc decreta;
id caput Arcadiæ erat</i> (Livy, xxxiii. 17), ‘These things
were decreed at Leucas (fem.); that (neut.) in the
capital (neut.) of Arcadia;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thebæ quod Bœotiæ caput
est</i>, ‘Thebes (fem. plur.) which (neut.) is the capital
(neut.) of Bœotia;’ Φόβος ἣν αἰδὼ εἴπομεν (Plat.),
‘Fear (masc.) which (fem.) we call modesty (fem.).’</p>

<p>A relative pronoun logically referring to an impersonal
indefinite subject usually follows the definite
predicate belonging to that subject; and, of course, the
predicate of the pronoun does the same. Thus we
have to say ‘<i>It</i> was a <i>man who</i> told me,’ and not ‘<i>It</i>
was a <i>man which</i> told me:’ ‘It is the lord <i>Chancellor
whose</i> decision is questioned.’ It is the same in
German and in French; as, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est eux qui ont bâti</i> (‘<i>It</i>
is <i>they who</i> have built’). In French, too, the person
of the verb in the relative sentence follows the definite
predicate, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est moi seul qui suis coupable</i> (‘<i>It</i> is I
alone <i>who am</i> guilty’); and it is the same in English&mdash;‘It
is I who am in fault.’ On the other hand, in
N.H.G. the use is to say <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du bist es, der mich gerettet
hat</i>, ‘Thou art <i>it</i> who me saved <i>has</i>,’ = ‘It is thou
that (who) hast saved me.’</p>

<p>In a relative sentence, the verb connected with
the subject of the governing sentence goes into the
first or second person, even though the relative
pronoun belongs to the predicate, and the third
person would strictly be natural: cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sum ego is
consul qui nefas arbitrer Gracchos laudare</i> =  ‘I am
not such a consul who <i>should think</i> (1st pers.) it
base to praise the Gracchi’ (Cicero); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neque tu is es qui
nescias</i> = ‘Nor are you he who <i>would ignore</i>’ (2nd
pers.), <i>i.e.</i> ‘Nor are you such a one as to ignore.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>In English, this construction is very common; as,
‘If thou beest he: but O how fall’n! how changed
From him, who in the happy realms of light <i>didst</i>
outshine myriads’ (Milton, Par. Lost, bk. i., 84, 85);
‘I am the person who <i>have</i> had’ (Goldsmith, Good-nat.
Man, iii.). This construction was common in Anglo-Saxon;
as, <i>Secga œnigum ðâra ðe tirleâses trôde
sceawode</i> = ‘Of the men to any of those (plur.) who
of the inglorious the track looked at (sing.)’ + ‘To any
of the men who looked at the track (of the) inglorious
(man)’ (Beowulf, 844).</p>

<p>So in French&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">JŹlthe d’ epi psychê Thêbaiou Teiresiao chryseon
skêptron echōne suis l’homme qui accouchai d’un
œuf</i> (Voltaire), ‘I am the man who laid (1st. pers.)
an egg’; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je suis l’individu qui ai fait le crime</i>, ‘I am
the person who <i>have done</i> the crime;’ and Italian&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Io
sono colui chi ho fatto</i>, ‘I am he who <i>have done</i>.’</p>

<p>The predicate or attribute, instead of agreeing
with the subject, or with the word which it serves to
define, may agree with a genitive dependent on that
subject; as, Ἦλθε δ’ ἐπί ψυχή Θηβαίου Τειρεσίαο χρύσεον
σκῆπτρον ἔχων (Homer, Od., xi. 90), ‘The soul (fem.)
of the Theban Teresias (masc.) came having (masc.)
a golden sceptre.’ In English we find ‘There <i>are</i>
eleven days’ <i>journey</i> from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea’
(Deut. i. 2).</p>

<p>In French it is customary to say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La plupart de ses
amis l’abandonnèrent</i>, ‘The most part of his friends
abandoned (plur.) him;’ but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La plupart du peuple
voulait</i>, ‘The most part of the people wished (sing.):’
in the former case the quantity of individuals is
regarded; in the latter the people are looked upon
as a totality divided.</p>

<p>The attribute sometimes in Latin and Greek,
referring to the person addressed, appears in the
vocative: as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quibus Hector ab oris Expectate venis?</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
(Vergil, Æn., ii. 282), ‘From what shores, Hector, O
long expected, dost come?’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stemmate quod Tusco
ramum millesime ducis</i> (Persius, iii. 28), ‘Because thou,
O thousandth, dost draw thy lineage from an Etruscan
tree.’ Thus, in Greek, Ὄλβιε, κῶρε, γένοιο (Theocr.,
Id., xvii. 66), ‘Mayst thou be happy, O boy,’ lit. ‘O
happy, O boy, mayst thou be!’</p>

<p>Such examples as these may aid us to understand
the way in which concord has spread beyond the area
to which it strictly belonged. And we may gather
from these some idea of the way in which this process
grew up in prehistorical times. We must remember,
however, that concord was not felt so indispensable
in the earliest stages of language, because absolute
forms without inflectional suffixes were then the rule.</p>

<p>The question now comes, What were the rudiments
from which concord proceeded? We must suppose that
a period once existed in which substantives coalesced
with the stem of the verb, and in which pronouns
could precede the stem, just as our actual verbal inflections
seem to owe their origin in many cases to
the coalition of pronouns with the stem. We must
therefore suppose that, just as it was possible to say
Διδω-μι (‘Give I’), so it was possible to say ‘Go father,’
‘Father go’ (for ‘Father goes’); and ‘I go,’ just as it
was possible to say ‘Go I,’ ‘Go thou,’ ‘Go he’ (instead
of ‘I go,’ etc.). There are actually some non-Indo-European
languages in which the third person singular
differs from the other persons by dispensing with any
suffix. Such is Hungarian,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> in which the root ‘fog,’
‘seize,’ is thus declined&mdash;<i lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">fog-ok</i>, <i lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">fogo-s</i>, <i lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">fog</i>. Here, then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
the original plan maintains itself, of coalition according
to the formula ‘Go-father,’ or ‘Father-go.’ In the next
stage, the subject is repeated, as, when we say Ἔγω δίδωμι,
we are really saying ‘<i>I</i> give <i>I</i>.’ This process is very
common in some modern languages, especially in poetry,
when emphasis is to be given to the subject: as, <i>The
night it was still, and the moon it shone</i> (Kirke White,
Gondoline);<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> <i>The skipper he stood beside the helm</i>
(Longfellow): <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Je le sais, moi</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Il ne voulut pas, lui</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toi,
tu vivras vil et malheureux</i>,&mdash;‘I know it, I;’ ‘He would
not, he;’ ‘Thou, thou shalt live vile and wretched.’
Similar is the anticipation of the subject by an indefinite
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">il</i>; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Il suffisait un mot</i>, ‘There sufficed a word.’
The pronoun was originally doubled only where it
was specially emphasised, just as in uneducated conversation
at the present day we hear such forms as <i>I says</i>,
<i>says I</i>. But such pronominal reduplication must have
spread, and have affected the verbal forms when they
were completely formed, just as it, at an earlier period,
affected the tense-stems. It is, however, by this time
so far forgotten that the termination of such a word as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legit</i> represents a personal pronoun, that its most common
use is to indicate its relationship with the subject
by mere concord; as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater legit</i>, lit. ‘Father read&mdash;he,’
<i>i.e.</i> ‘father reads.’ In fact, the personal endings at the
present day merely serve to mark the verb as such, and
sometimes to express the difference between different
moods.</p>

<p>In the case of nouns, the concord of gender and
number, at any rate, is first formed in the pronoun to
which reference is made, to which gender, too, owes its
origin, as in such cases as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illæ mulieres</i>, ‘those women
(nom.);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illas mulieres</i> (acc.).</p>

<p>Concord in case appears first in apposition; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imperatoris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Cæsaris exercitus</i>, ‘The army of Cæsar (gen.)
the commander (gen.),’ where it serves to show that
both nouns have the same relation to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercitus</i>. But
here there is no more actual necessity for employing
the case-ending twice, than there is for repeating the
pronominal suffix in the case of the verb. This we
may see in such cases as <i>King Arthur’s seat</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La gloire
de la nation française</i>, ‘The glory of the French
nation.’ A concord in gender and number occurs,
even at the present day, only where it is demanded by
the nature of the case; as, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La dame sur le visage de
laquelle les grâces étaient peintes</i> (Fénelon), ‘The lady
on the face of whom the graces were painted.’</p>

<p>The concord of substantives in apposition having
been the first to form itself&mdash;as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæsaris imperatoris
Romani</i>, ‘Of Cæsar (gen.) the Roman-commander
(gen.)’&mdash;we must suppose the concord of the attributival
and predicatival adjective to have been modelled
upon that use; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæsaris domini potentis</i>, ‘Of Cæsar
(gen.) the powerful master (gen.),’ or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæsaris invicti</i>,
‘Of Cæsar (gen.) unconquered (gen.).’ In other words,
their origin reaches back to a time when the adjective
still occupied the same category as the substantive, and
was not yet thought of as occupying a category of its
own. The transition is marked by such substantives
as are called, in Latin grammars, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mobilia</i>, which in the
forms of their genders resemble adjectives. Such as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coquus</i>, ‘cook’ (masc.); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coqua</i>, ‘cook’ (fem.): <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominus</i>,
‘lord;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">domina</i>, ‘lady:’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rex</i>, ‘king;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regina</i>, ‘queen.’ As
these substantives passed into adjectives, they maintained
the concord, and it then came to be regarded as
of the essence of the adjective.

<span class="medium">ECONOMY OF EXPRESSION.</span></h2>

<p>Language, as a rule, employs no more material than
is necessary to make the hearer or reader understand
the meaning intended to be conveyed by the speaker
or writer. This statement must be taken merely
generally, for it admits of many exceptions. But, as a
rule, language, like a careful housewife, husbands its
resources, and tends rather to economy than to lavishness
in their employment. Everywhere in language
we meet with forms of expression which contain just so
much as is needed to make the employer of language
understood, and no more. In fact, the supply offered
by language depends on the demand, and on this alone.
A gesticulation may supply the place of a sentence; a
nod, a frown, a smile may speak as plainly as any words.
Much, too, must depend upon the situation: on the relations
of the speakers to each other; their knowledge of
what is passing in each other’s minds; and their common
sentiments with regard to the subject discussed.
If we consider a form of expression which shall convey
a thought under all possible conditions to any possible
hearer as the only correct standard, and measure all
other forms with that standard, then all these will
appear imperfect, or, as grammarians would say,
elliptical.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>Practically, however, ellipse should be assumed in
a minimum of cases, and each form of expression should
be referred to its origin. Otherwise, we must be content
to regard ellipse as an essential part of language;
in fact, we shall have to regard language as habitually
containing less than ought rightly to be expressed, and
hence we should have to regard most expressions as
elliptical.</p>

<p>We will consider first the cases in which a word or
phrase is said to be <i>supplied</i> from what precedes or
what follows. It hardly seems that we are justified in
using the word <i>supplied</i>. Take such a sentence as <i>Is
Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</i> (Rich.
II., III. ii. 14). We can hardly contend that in the perfectly
expressed sentence we should have to supply
<i>dead</i> after <i>Bushy</i>, <i>Green</i>, and <i>the Earl</i>, <i>etc.</i> Again, in
such a sentence as <i>He saw me and grew pale</i>, it seems
unnecessary to supply <i>he</i> with <i>grew pale</i>; nor in such
a combination as <i>in fear and hope</i> need we supply <i>in</i>
before <i>hope</i> merely because we can also say <i>in fear and
in hope</i>. It seems more correct to drop the notion of
<i>supplying</i>, and to think of single <i>positing</i> with plural
reference&mdash;regarding what usually is called a sentence,
not as an independent self-contained integer, but as a
link in a continuous series.</p>

<p>It is common to assume an ellipse in such cases as
‘the German and French languages,’ and still more
in the form ‘the German language and the French.’
But we have really here a pair of elements standing in
the same relation to a third. That this is so, we see
by the fact that there are other languages in which the
two elements are really treated as a unity and attached
as such to the third, which then becomes strictly speaking
the second. This is shown by the use of the plural.
We say, for instance, in Latin&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quarta et Martia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
legiones</i> (Brut. apud Cicero, ad Fam., ii. 19), ‘the fourth
(sing.) and the Martian (sing.) legions (plur.),’ beside
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legio Martia quartaque</i>, ‘the legion Martian and fourth’
(both in Cicero); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falernum et Capuanum agros</i>, ‘the
Falernian (sing.) and Capuan (sing.) fields (plur.)’
(Livy, xxii. 15): Italian&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">le lingue Greca e Latina</i>, ‘the
languages Greek (sing.) and Latin (sing.),’ besides <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la
lingua Greca e Latina</i>, ‘the language Greek and Latin:’
in French&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les langues Française et Allemande</i>:&mdash;so,
<i>the fourth and fifth regiments</i>; <i>the second and third
days</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way, in the case of such sentences as
<i>John writes well, James badly</i>, we are prone to assume
an ellipse. But that the current assumption of an
ellipse cannot be always right is proved by the fact
that even in English we sometimes meet with a plural
predicate: as, ‘Your sister as well as myself, said Booby,
<i>are</i> greatly obliged’ (Fielding, J. Andr., iv. 7); ‘Old
Sir John with half a dozen more <i>are</i> at the door,’
(Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV. II. iv.): as against, ‘Ely,
with Richmond <i>troubles</i> me’ (Rich. III., IV. iii.);
‘Until her back, as well as sides, was like to crack’
(But., Hud., II. i. 85).<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>In Latin, we actually find this construction with
the ablative absolute: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ille Antiocho, hic Mithridate
pulsis</i>, ‘the former when Antiochus, the latter when
Mithridates <small>WERE</small> defeated’ (Tacitus); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod tu aut illa
queri possitis</i>, ‘what thou or she require could (the
verb plural)’ (Tullia, ap. Cicero, ad Fam., iv. 5): <span class="nowrap">cf.&mdash;</span>

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Not the King’s crown nor the deputed sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The marshal’s truncheon nor the judge’s robe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Become them.’<br /></span>
</span></span>

(Shakespeare, Meas. for Meas., II. ii. 60); ‘For there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
nor yew nor cypress <i>spread</i> their gloom’ (Th. Campbell,
Theodoric). So in French&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Ni l’or ni la grandeur
ne nous rendent heureux’</span> (La Fontaine), ‘Neither
gold nor grandeur <i>make</i> us happy:’ and in Latin&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Erant
quibus nec Senatus gloriari nec princeps
<i>possent</i>,’</span> lit. ‘There were (some) of whom neither
Senate boast nor the Emperor <i>could</i> (plur.)’ (Plin., Pan.,
75).<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> This plural has originated from cases where the
copulative connection could be substituted without
essential alteration of meaning&mdash;as, ‘Yew and cypress
spread not there their gloom,’&mdash;and has thence been
extended by analogy. In fact, for the instinct of
language, the predicate has been posited once and not
twice.</p>

<p>In sentences like ‘I will come and do it,’ ‘Who
steals my purse steals trash’ (Othello, III. iii. 157),
‘Who was the thane lives yet’ (Macbeth, I. iii. 109), we
have instances of an element common to the principal
and subordinate sentence, and also in such sentences
as ‘It is thy sovereign speaks to thee,’ a variety of
sentences constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ. Sometimes also, in
German, we find such sentences as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was ich da
träumend jauchzt und litt, muss wachend nun erfahren</i>
(Goethe), lit. ‘What I there dreaming cheered-at and
suffered must waking now experience;’ with which we
may compare sentences like Milton’s ‘Thou art my
son beloved: in him am pleased,’ and ‘Here’s a young
maid with travel much oppressed, and <i>faints</i> for
succour’<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> (Shakespeare, As You Like It, II. iv. 75).
It occurs frequently in dialogue that words of one
speaker are not repeated by another, and they are
ordinarily described as being <i>supplied</i>. Really, however,
dialogue must be regarded as a continuous whole, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
that, <i>e.g.</i>, the words of one speaker (or their contents)
form subject to predicate uttered by the other. <span class="nowrap">Cf.&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">‘O Banquo, Banquo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our royal master’s murdered&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(<i>Lady Macb.</i>) Woe! alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, in our house?’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we take a sentence like ‘<i>my</i> relatives and friends,’
the common element <i>my</i> stands at the outset of the
whole sentence; it is then nearer indeed to <i>relatives</i>,
but is without difficulty referred to <i>friends</i>. But insertion
in the second part of the sentence is also
possible: cf. ‘It (<i>i.e.</i> love) shall be (too) sparing and
too severe’ (Ven. and Adon., 1155), ‘Beggars (sitting)
in their stocks refuge their shame that (<i>i.e.</i> because)
many have (sat) and many must sit there’ (Rich. II.,
V. v. 27); ‘of such dainty and such picking grievances’
(2 Hen. IV., IV. i. 198).<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> In this case, the first portion
of the sentence remains incomplete until the common
element has been spoken or written; and this serves
to complete the first and the second part of the sentence
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Sometimes the common element stands in different
relations to the two others with which it is connected.
Then concord must be violated: and different
languages try to avoid this breach of concord in
different ways.</p>

<p>We, in English, admit the want of concord in such
cases as ‘She <small>LOVES</small> him not less than I (<small>LOVE</small> him);’
‘He thinks so: not I;’ ‘They are going to-morrow: I
too.’ The case is similar in French: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous partez&mdash;moi
aussi</i> (= ‘You depart&mdash;me also’); and in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du
gehst&mdash;ich auch</i> (= ‘Thou goest&mdash;I too’). The sequence
of tenses is not observed in ‘Therefore they thought
it good you hear a play’ (Tam. of Shrew, Introduc. ii.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
136);<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> ‘’Twere good you do so much for charity’
(Merch. of Ven., IV. i. 261). The infinitive has
to be borrowed from the finite verb in cases like ‘He
has done as he was bound;’ ‘He is gone where he was
told.’</p>

<p>It is, of course, harder to find cases of discord in
<i>gender</i> in English than in more highly inflected
languages. In French, however, we find <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paul et
Virginie étaient ignorants</i> (B. de S. Pierre), ‘Paul
and Virginia were ignorant [masc. plur.]:’ and
also <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le fer, le bandeau et la flamme est toute prête</i>
(Racine), ‘The iron, the bandage and the flame is
quite ready;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un homme ou une femme noyée</i>
(Boniface), ‘It is a man or a woman drowned (sing.
fem.):’ cf. Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Visæ nocturno tempore faces ardorque
cœli</i> (Cicero, Cat., iii. 8). The case is similar in
Italian and Spanish. In English, we find such
sentences as ‘I am happy to hear it was his horse and
not himself <i>who</i> fell in the combat.’<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>A single word may actually stand in relation to two
or more verbs, and represent two or more cases; as,
<i>which</i> (accusative to <i>spit</i> and nominative to <i>is</i>), <i>however,
they pretend to spit wholly out of themselves, is
improved by the same arts</i> (Swift, Battle of the Books,
p. 29, Cassell’s Edit.): so in Latin&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quibus insputari
solitumst atque iis profuit</i> (Plaut., Captivi), ‘On whom
it is customary that it should be spat, and (this) has
been good for them.’</p>

<p>In Latin, again, we find a nominative actually
representing an accusative; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui fatetur ... et ...
non timeo</i> (Cicero) = ‘Who confesses ... and ...
(whom) I do not fear:’ and, again, a dative represents
an accusative in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui fidem habent et bene rebus suis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
consulere arbitrantur</i> (Cicero), ‘In whom they trust
and whom they deem to manage their affairs well.’</p>

<p>There are, again, cases in which the two principal
notions are connected by a <i>link</i> which serves to define
more closely the nature of the connection. Such links
are often dispensed with, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hectoris Andromache</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæcilia Metelli</i>; or, <i>The Duke of Westminster’s
Ormonde</i>. It is misleading, in such cases, to say that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uxor</i>, ‘wife,’ or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filia</i>, ‘daughter,’ or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colt</i> is to be
<i>supplied</i>; indeed, no definite expression of the kind
could be supplied unless the hearer or reader were
conversant with the situation; and even then it does
not follow that any one of the three words which we
have mentioned would actually be supplied. The
truth is that the genitive, in these cases, denotes a
connection which may be rendered more definite as
our knowledge of the <i>situation</i> becomes more intimate.</p>

<p>Indications of direction were no doubt originally
associated with verbs of motion only; as, <i>I am going
thither</i>. But they are now found attached to verbs of
preparing, wishing and the like: as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wo wollen sie
hin?</i> = ‘Where will you to?’ (= ‘Whither will you?’ =
‘Whither are you going?’); <i>He purposeth to Athens</i>
(Shakespeare, Ant. and Cleo., III. i. 35); <i>I must to
Coventry</i> (Rich. II., I. ii. 56); <i>To Cabin! silence</i>,
(Temp., I. i.); <i>To horse! to horse!</i> (Rich. II., II. i.);
<i>Back to thy punishment, false fugitive</i>; <i>Forward,
brave champions, to the fight</i> (Scott, Lay of Last
Minstrel, v. 20); <i>And thou shalt back to France</i>
(Marlowe, Edward II., I. i.); <i>Let us across the country
to Terracina</i> (Bulwer, Rienzi, iii. 1).<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Similarly, the
common Scottish phrase <i>to want in</i>, for <i>to wish to enter</i>.
In these cases, we must suppose that the notions of
preparing, wishing, etc., and of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus ad quem</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
present themselves at once to our consciousness, and
that they are directly connected as psychological
subject and predicate. Then the ordinary construction
in such cases, as, <i>They are going home</i>, or <i>to Rome</i>,
occurred to the recollection, and the analogy of this
form of expression co-operated to produce the form in
question. The form has now become so usual that it
cannot fairly be described as elliptical. Other similar
phrases are <i>I never let him from home</i>; <i>I will not let
you out</i>; <i>Let me in</i>; and, again, such as <i>He is away</i>, or <i>He
is off to Paris</i>; in which case <i>away</i> and <i>off to Paris</i>
are to be taken as predicates, and <i>is</i> as copula. With
this construction may be classed the so-called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">constructio
prægnans</i>, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditus in nubem</i> (Vergil, Georgics,
I. 442) = ‘Hidden into a cloud,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘Having passed
into a cloud and hidden itself.’</p>

<p>In Latin, a nominative case standing as subject is
sometimes followed by an accusative standing without
a verb; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicero Cassio salutem</i>, ‘Cicero to Cassius
greeting:’ similarly, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unde mihi tam fortem?</i> (Horace,
Sat., II. v. 102); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sus Minervam</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortes fortuna</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dii
meliora</i> (Cicero, Phil., viii. 3); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Di vostram fidem</i> (Plaut.,
Captivi, 591).</p>

<p>In these cases, two notions are combined in the
form of nominative and accusative because they stand
in the same relation to each other as, in a more complete
sentence, obtains between subject and predicate.</p>

<p>Similarly, in French, we find expressions like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vite
un flambeau!</i> (Racine), ‘Quick! a torch;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Citoyens,
trève à cette dispute!</i> (Ponsard), ‘Citizens, enough of
this dispute.’</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, a nominative standing as subject
is connected with an adverb; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæc hactenus</i>, ‘this so
far;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">an tu id melius?</i> ‘or (do you know) this better?’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne quid temere</i>, ‘nothing rash;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne quid nimis</i>, ‘nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
too-much;’ ταῦτα μὲν οὖν δὲ ὁὗτως (= ‘that thou therefore
thus’) (Plato). Similarly, we find in English,
<i>one step enough for me</i> (Newman’s hymn, ‘Lead
Kindly Light’). Many instances of such constructions
may be found in Pepys’ Diary; as, <i>I to bed</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes we meet with sentences like <i>I will
give you an example how to do the thing</i>. In this case,
the subordinate sentence is combined with a principal
sentence without some element of the sentence like,
<i>of how</i> or <i>as how you should do it</i>. Thus we find sentences
like the following:<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> <i>To talk to a man in a state
of moral corruption to elevate himself</i>. Then sentences
like <i>You look what is the matter</i>; where the sentence,
if fully expressed, would be <i>Look to see what is the
matter</i>. Similarly, in Greek, Ὅρη δίφρον, Εὐνόα, αὐτᾷ
(Theoc., Idyll., xv. 2), ‘Look (for) a chair for her.’
Similarly, we have such phrases as <i>As far as that goes</i>;
<i>As far as I know</i>; <i>To be plain</i>: and, again, such compressed
sentences as <i>in short</i>; <i>quant à cela</i> (‘as for
that’), etc.</p>

<p>In cases like <i>to the right</i>, <i>to the left</i>, the situation
again stands instead of a substantive. Just so, in
Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calida frigida (aqua)</i>,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> ‘warm, cold (<i>i.e.</i> water):’
<i>Hot or cold?</i> (with reference to refreshments); <i>Burgundy</i>,
<i>Champagne</i>; <i>agnina</i>, <i>caprina</i> (<i>caro</i>), ‘lamb, goat
(<i>i.e.</i> flesh);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Appia (via)</i>, ‘Appian (road);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martia (aqua)</i>,
‘Martian (water);’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">une première représentation</i>, ‘a first
performance;’ <i>a tenth</i>; <i>the Russian</i>, <i>French (language)</i>;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Marseillaise</i>. In these cases, if we speak of ellipse
at all, we must remember that we could not in
many cases supply the ellipse without the situation.
If we were to say, <i>Bring the old instead of the
new</i>, this would be meaningless unless we had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
wine before us: unless, indeed, we had something else,
as <i>clothes</i>, for instance, in which case likewise the
situation would supply the sense required. The more
‘usual’ such ways of speech become, the less do they
depend on the situation. When we speak of <i>Champagne</i>,
<i>Bordeaux</i>, <i>Gruyère</i>, etc., the word has passed
from the position of an epithet into that of a true
substantive.</p>

<p>In the case of genitive determinants, we meet with
a similar development. An Oxford student would
have no difficulty in understanding what was meant
by <i>We were beaten by St. John’s (College)</i>, nor a
medical man by <i>I am house surgeon at St. George’s</i>.
Similarly, we find in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Saint Pierre (fête)</i>,
‘S. Peter’s (day);’ and, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad Vestæ (templum)</i>,
‘to Vesta’s (temple);’ and in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heut ist Simon
und Juda’s</i>, ‘To-day is Simon and Juda’s (feast)’ (Sch.).
In these cases, no ellipse can be assumed, for it is
evident that the words are already apprehended as
simple substantives.</p>

<p>In such forms as <i>No further!</i> the psychological
predicate alfone is expressed, the unexpressed subject
being the person to whom the words are addressed.
We may gather that these words are apprehended as
in the accusative case from parallel instances in other
languages; as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotta finem</i>, ‘Cotta (made) an end;’
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Keinen schritt weiter</i>, <i>No step further!</i> It is the same
with sentences like <i>Good day</i>, <i>My best thanks</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
voyage</i> (‘Pleasant trip!’), etc. In sentences like
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christianos ad leones</i> (‘The Christians to the lions’) or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manum de tabula</i> (‘Hand from table’), we might
certainly take <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christianos</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manum</i> as the psychological
subject, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad leones</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de tabula</i> as the predicate;
but the accusative in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christianos</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manum</i> shows
that a subject is really conceived of as taken from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
situation, and that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christianos</i>, are regarded as
the object of such subject. It is the same with cases:
as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultro istum a me</i> (Plautus), ‘Spontaneously him
from me;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex pede Herculem</i>, ‘From foot Hercules;’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex ungue leonem</i>, ‘From claw the lion;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malam illi
pestem</i>, ‘To him the plague’ (Cicero); <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tiberium in
Tiberim</i> (Suet., Tib., 75), ‘Tiberius into the Tiber.’
In German we have cases like <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Den kopf in die höhe</i>
= ‘(The) head into the height’ = ‘Heads up!’ and, in
English, probably such cases as <i>Heads up! Hands
down!</i> are conceived of as in the accusative case. Other
cases also, as well as adverbs, can be thus used: as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed
de hoc alio loco pluribus</i> = ‘But more of this hereafter;’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hæc nimis iracunde</i> = ‘This too angrily.’ Similarly,
<i>So Gareth to him</i> (Tennyson, Gareth and Lynette, p.
47); <i>Whereat the maiden petulant</i> (ibid., p. 77).</p>

<p>Sometimes, as in the rhetorical figure which we
call aposiopesis, the psychological predicate as well is
taken from the situation; in this case gesticulation and
the tone of the speaker may do much to promote the
clearness of the situation. Thus we have suppressed
threats, like the well-known Vergilian, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quos ego</i> (Æn.,
i. 135), ‘Whom I!’<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>Again, we find such expressions as, <i>To be thus is
nothing, but to be safely thus (is something)</i>.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Again,
take such expressions as <i>the wretch!</i> <i>A maid and be
so martial!</i> (Shakespeare, 1 Hen. VI., I. iv.); and,
again, exclamations such as <i>So young and so depraved!</i>
<i>To sleep so long!</i> and, <i>To throw me plumply aside!</i>
(Coleridge, Picc., i. 2). Under this head will come
the so-called Infinitive of exclamation in Latin.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hunccine solem tam nigrum surrexe mihi</i> (Horace,
Sat., I. ix. 72), ‘Oh that this wretched day (black sun)
has risen for me!’ This use is also very common in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
French; as, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfoncer ce couteau moi-même, chose horrible</i>
(Ponsard),<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> ‘To plunge this knife (into him) myself,
horrible notion!’</p>

<p>Similarly, dependent sentences may become by us
independent; as, ‘O <i>that</i> this too too solid flesh would
melt!’ <i>If I only knew!</i> <i>O had we some bright little isle
of our own!</i> (T. Moore). This use is similar in Anglo-Saxon.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>It is similar when conditional sentences are used as
threats; as, <i>If you only dare!</i> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum si Addideris!</i>
(Terence), ‘If you say another word!’&mdash;or when such
are set down and left uncompleted; as, <i>But if he
doesn’t come after all!</i> French is full of parallels: cf.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et quand je pense que j’ai été plusieurs fois demander
des messes à ce magicien d’Urbain</i> (De Vigny), ‘And if
I consider that I have several times asked this conjurer
Urbain for masses!’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puisque je suis là, si nous
liquidions un peu ce vieux compte</i> (Daudet), ‘As I am
here (what) if we settled this old account?’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est à
peine si ma tête entre dans ce chapeau</i> (Acad.), ‘It is
(only) with difficulty if my head gets into this hat;’
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passez votre chemin, mon ami. Que je passe mon chemin?
Oui, qui, qui le pourrait</i> (Regnard) = ‘Go on, my
friend!&mdash;I, go on?&mdash;Yes, yes, if it were possible.’
These sentences with <i>that</i> are originally predicates; or,
speaking from a grammatical point of view, objects.
<i>That I might be there to see!</i> if fully expressed, would
be <i>I wish that I could be there to see</i>. Cf. <i>I am the
best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where
’tis spoken</i> (Shakespeare, Tempest, I. ii.); <i>Those other
two equalled with me in fate, so were I equalled with
them in renown</i> (Milton, Par. Lost, iii. 33); <i>Would to
God we had died by the hand of the Lord</i> (Exod. xvi. 3).

<span class="medium">RISE OF WORD-FORMATION AND INFLECTION.</span></h2>

<p>We have in former chapters dealt with, and frequently
alluded to, the fact that much which is new in derivation
and inflection is due to analogy. <i>Much</i> is due
to this, but not all; and we must now ask whence
originated these processes of derivation and flection,
which cannot be explained as due to analogy, <i>i.e.</i> those
which, instead of being moulded on a given pattern,
have, on the contrary, served as the model for others.
It is clear that as soon as language arose, even in its
most primitive state, words must have been combined
syntactically, in however simple a manner. Groups
of etymologically connected words, words derived the
one from the other by suffixes (as <i>long</i>, <i>length</i>; <i>king</i>,
<i>kingdom</i>) or by flection (as <i>book</i>, <i>books</i>; <i>go</i>, <i>goes</i>),&mdash;such
groups need not have existed at once, nay, must have
arisen only gradually, and in course of time. How
did they arise? Theoretically, three ways only seem
possible.</p>

<p>Words formed independently for cognate ideas,
might accidentally resemble each other so closely as
to group themselves also phonetically, <i>i.e.</i> to be
sounded more or less alike; or&mdash;what is essentially
the same, though not quite so improbable&mdash;words
originally different and expressing different ideas,
might, in course of time, so develop in meaning and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
sound as to become members of a group. A case
somewhat of this nature we studied in our word
<i>bound</i> (cf. page 194), which, originally different in
sound and form from the then existing past participle
of <i>to bind</i>, has come to resemble it so much in form, and
was used in such a sense as to cause all but students
of language to group these forms together.</p>

<p>A second way is a differentiation in sound, <i>i.e.</i> two
forms may arise, under the influence of accent or other
causes, from the same word, which two forms then
come to be differentiated in meaning. We have in
this way, for instance, the two forms of the past tense
of the verb <i>werden</i> (to become) in German, <i>ward</i> and
<i>wurde</i>. These arose absolutely independently of any
difference in meaning; once having arisen, a custom
sprang up of using the one (<i>ward</i>) as aorist and the
other (<i>wurde</i>) by preference as imperfect tense.</p>

<p>That in the above examples, the form which later
on became <i>bound</i> is not itself an original creation, or
that, in German, the two forms of the past tense were
due largely to analogy, does not affect their value as
illustrative of our point. We readily understand that
both these ways were and are possible, but, at the same
time, that in only very few cases they have been
followed.</p>

<p>Only one way of explaining the origin of flection
remains&mdash;‘composition.’</p>

<p>In order to explain how derivation and flection can
have been derived from composition, we will go somewhat
deeply into the nature and application of the
latter. We shall then see how impossible it is to draw
a sharp line between syntactical co-ordination, composition,
derivation, and flection anywhere, and then&mdash;and
only then&mdash;we shall acquire an insight into the
true nature of the subject of this chapter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>If we study the composition of words in the various
Indo-European languages, we soon learn to distinguish
two different kinds. In one we find the so-called
crude forms (that is to say, those forms of the words
which, <small>WITH THE CASE-ENDINGS</small>, make up what we now
consider the complete word) combined with other
crude forms, the last of which alone assumes these
case-endings. To illustrate this we must of course go
back to ancient languages, in which this crude form is
clearly distinct from the nominative or any other case.
We have plenty of such compounds even now in
English and other modern languages; but, in consequence
of the wearing off of terminations, the most
undoubted examples would illustrate (<i>i.e.</i> throw light
upon) nothing. In Sanscrit, for instance, there are
three plants which in the nominative singular would be
called <i>çaças</i> (or <i>çaçaḥ</i>), <i>kuças (ḥ)</i> or <i>kuçam</i> (masc. or
neut.), and <i>palâçam</i>. It is the crude forms of these
nouns (without their nominative&mdash;<i>s</i> and <i>m</i>) which are
used in the compound <i>çaça-kuça-palâçam</i>, which
indicates a collection of the three. Again <i>râjâ</i> (with
long <i>â</i>) is the nominative form of a stem <i>râjan</i>
(‘king’) or <i>râja</i> (with short <i>a</i>). In the compound
<i>râja-purushas (h)</i> we again find the crude form, this
time the shorter form of the base: <i>purushas</i> means
‘man’ and the whole (= ‘king-man’) stands for <i>king’s
man</i>. We might illustrate this kind by such words as
our <i>tragi-comic</i>, <i>melodramatic</i> (<i>melos</i> = ‘song’).</p>

<p>In the other kind of compounds we find two or
more fully inflected forms combined in one group.
This is the method of composition which survives
in our present linguistic consciousness, which sees
compounds of the second kind even in those which are
historically connected with the Indo-European type,
illustrated in the former paragraph by <i>râja-purushas</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
The wearing off of well-nigh all case-endings has in
the present language almost completely obliterated the
difference between crude forms and nominatives of
nouns and adjectives or the infinitives of verbs. Hence,
at present, the ordinary speaker realises no difference
between, e.g., <i>noon</i> in <i>noon-tide</i> and the word <i>noon</i>
in <i>It is noon</i>. Yet the compound <i>noon-tide</i> belongs
historically to the former class, and <i>noon</i> is there a
‘crude form,’ if we may still so call it. In our following
study of composition as at present employed in
the English language, we neglect the scientific origin,
but base our classification on appearance; in the present
case, on present linguistic consciousness. One of the
fullest and best-known lists of compounds in the English
language is perhaps that given by Morris (Histor.
Outlines, p. 222). We shall largely draw upon it in
the following study, though we have, in our enumeration,
rather considered the character of the component
parts than, as Mr. Morris does, that of the function of
the compound.</p>

<p>I. Nouns are compounded with Nouns&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Both in the same case; <i>i.e.</i> in apposition, the
one explanatory of, or defining the other (in which
case one of the nouns has a function almost, if not
quite, identical with that of an adjective). Instances
are <i>spear-plant</i>, <i>noon-tide</i>, <i>church-yard</i>, <i>headman</i>, <i>oak-tree</i>,
<i>master-tailor</i>, <i>merchant-tailor</i>, <i>prince-regent</i>, <i>water-course</i>,
<i>watershed</i>, <i>head-waiter</i>, <i>plough-boy</i>, <i>bishopdom</i>
(found in Milton, <i>dom</i> = ‘jurisdiction’), <i>bishopric</i> (<i>ric</i>
= A.S. <i>rîce</i>, ‘power,’ ‘domain’), <i>bandog</i> (= <i>band</i> +
<i>dog</i>), <i>barn</i> (<i>bere</i>, i.e. <i>barley</i> + <i>ern</i>, i.e. ‘storehouse’),
<i>bridegroom</i> (<i>bride</i> + <i>groom</i> = <i>goom</i> = A.S. <i>guma</i>, ‘man’<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>),
<i>bridal</i> (<i>bride</i> + <i>ale</i> = ‘bride-feast’), <i>cowslip</i> (<i>cow</i> + <i>slip</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
A.S. <i>cu-slyppe</i> = ‘cow dung’), <i>hussy</i> (= ‘<i>house-wife</i>’&mdash;Skeat,
Prin. Eng. Etymol., p. 422), <i>Lord-lieutenant</i>,
<i>earlmarshal</i>, <i>wer-wolf</i> (‘man-wolf,’ A.S. <i>wer</i> = ‘a man’),
<i>world</i> (<i>weoruld</i>, <i>wer</i> = ‘man’ + <i>ældu</i> = ‘age,’ ‘old age,’
‘age of man’), <i>yeoman</i> (= ‘village-man’&mdash;see Skeat),
<i>orchard</i> (A.S. <i>orceard</i>, <i>ortgeard</i>, metathesis = <i>wort-yard</i>
= ‘vegetable-garden’), <i>Lammas</i> (= <i>hláf-maesse</i>
= ‘loaf-mass,’ ‘day of offering,’ ‘first-fruits’), <i>handi-work</i>
(<i>hand</i> + <i>geweorc</i> = ‘hand-work’), <i>mildew</i> (= ‘honey
dew,’ <i>mil</i> = ‘honey,’ A.S. <i>mele</i>), <i>penny-worth</i>.</p>

<p>2. Genitive + Nominative. <i>Doomsday</i>, <i>Thursday</i>,
<i>Tuesday</i> (day of <i>Tiw</i>, the godhead), <i>kinsman</i>, <i>trades-union</i>,
<i>calf’s-foot</i> (calf’s-foot jelly), <i>lady day</i> (<i>lady</i> as a
feminine had no <i>s</i> in the genitive), <i>daisy</i> (‘day’s
eye,’ A.S. <i>dæges
4 éage</i>), <i>Wednesday</i> (‘Wodan’s day’),
<i>shilling’s-worth</i>.</p>

<p>3. Noun + Verbal Noun (the former having the
function of object to the verb cognate with the latter).
<i>Man-killer</i>, <i>blood-shedding</i>, <i>auger</i> (i.e. ‘nauger,’ <i>a nauger</i>
having been divided as if = <i>an auger</i>; A.S. <i>nafu-gár</i>,
‘nave (of a wheel)’ ‘-borer,’ ‘-piercer’), <i>groundsel</i>
(A.S. <i>grunde</i> + <i>swelge</i> = ‘ground-swallower’ = ‘abundant
weed;’ already in the Saxon corrupted from
<i>gunde-swilge</i> = ‘poison-swallower,’ with reference to
healing effects),<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> <i>lady</i> (<i>hláf-dige</i>, ‘loaf-kneader’),
<i>soothsayer</i> (= ‘truth-speaker’).</p>

<p>4. Two Nouns in other relations: <i>nightingale</i> (A.S.
<i>nihte-gale</i> = ‘night-singer’), <i>nightmare</i> (<i>mara</i>, ‘an incubus,’
by night).</p>

<p>II. Nouns are compounded with Adjectives.</p>

<i>sweet-william</i>, <i>lucky-bag</i>, <i>midday</i>, <i>alderman</i> (<i>ealdor-man</i>
= ‘elder-man’), <i>Gospel</i> (<i>god-spell</i> = ‘good-spell’ =
‘good tiding’), <i>holiday</i> (= ‘holy day’), <i>halibut</i> (=
‘holy but’ = ‘holy plaice for eating on holy days’),
<i>hoar-frost</i>, <i>hoar-hound</i> (the hoar or greyish <i>húna</i>, i.e.
the plant now called horehound), <i>hind-leg</i>, <i>neighbour</i>
(= ‘near-dweller’), <i>midriff</i> (<i>mid</i> + <i>hrif</i> = <i>belly</i>), <i>titmouse</i>
(small sparrow; <i>mouse</i> here = A.S. <i>máse</i>, small
bird, not the A.S. <i>mûs</i> from which the common word
<i>mouse</i>).</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Adjectives. <i>Barefoot</i>.</p>

<p>2. Substantive and Adjective.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Nouns. <i>Furlong</i> (= ‘furrow long’ = ‘the length
of a furrow’).</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Adjectives. In many of these the noun has very
much the functions of an adverb. <i>Blood-red</i>, <i>snow-white</i>,
<i>fire-proof</i>, <i>shameful</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>manly</i> (i.e. ‘man-like’),
<i>scot-free</i> (free from paying <i>scot</i>, i.e. a contribution).</p>

<p>4. Numeral + Substantive.</p>

<p><i>Sennight</i> (= ‘seven night’), <i>fortnight</i> (‘fourteen
night’), <i>twi-light</i> (= ‘double light’ = ‘doubtful light’).</p>

<p>III. Pronoun and Substantive. <i>Self-will</i>, <i>self-esteem</i>.</p>

<p>IV. 1. Substantive and Verb (or Verbal Stem).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>Verbs. <i>Back-bite</i>, <i>blood-let</i>, <i>brow-beat</i>, <i>hoodwink</i>,
<i>caterwaul</i> (= ‘to wail like cats’).</p>

<p>2. Verb and Substantive.</p>

<p>Nouns. <i>Grindstone</i>, <i>bakehouse</i>, <i>wash-tub</i>, <i>pickpocket</i>,
<i>brimstone</i> (i.e. <i>brenstone</i> = ‘burning stone’), <i>rearmouse</i>
(<i>hrére-mús</i>, <i>hreran</i>, ‘to flutter’), <i>wormwood</i> (A.S.
<i>wermód</i> = <i>weremód</i>, <i>werian</i>, ‘to defend,’ <i>mód</i> = ‘mood’
= ‘mind;’ ‘that which preserves the mind’), <i>breakfast</i>,
<i>spend-thrift</i> (cf. <i>wast-thrift</i>&mdash;Middleton, A Trick
to Catche the Old One, II. i.).</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Dear-bought</i>, <i>full-fed</i>, <i>high-born</i>, <i>dead-beat</i>.</p>

<p>(In <i>well-bred</i>, <i>well-disposed</i>, etc., there is, of course,
no doubt that the first element is an adverb.)</p>

<p>VI. Adjective and Verb. <i>White-wash.</i></p>

<p>VII. Adverb and Verb. <i>Cross-question</i>, <i>doff</i> (do-off),
<i>don</i> (do-on).</p>

<p>Further compounds we meet are made up of&mdash;</p>

<p>VIII. Pronouns with Pronouns. <i>Somewhat.</i></p>

<i>gelic</i> = like, A.S. <i>aelc</i>).</p>

<p>XIV. Adverbs with Verbs. <i>Foretell</i>, <i>gainsay</i>, <i>withstand</i>,
etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>We also find more than two members formed into
one; such as <i>man-o’-war</i>, <i>will-o’-the-wisp</i>, <i>brother-in-law</i>,
<i>nevertheless</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>, etc. Sentences and phrases
coalesce; as in <i>good-bye</i> (= ‘God be with you’), the
provincial <i>beleddy</i> (= ‘By our lady,’ <i>i.e.</i> the Virgin
Mary), <i>may-be</i> (provincially in America written <i>mebbe</i>),
and, aided by metaphorical usage, <i>forget-me-not</i>, <i>kiss-me-quick</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>The student should carefully go over these examples,
and, in each of them, attentively study the
full force of the compound, and see what is really
expressed by the component part, and what implied
by the mere fact that they are thus joined.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> If he is
acquainted with any foreign languages, he should also
study all the various habits of these languages as regards
composition. He will then gain a clear insight into
the nature of the process, and see how impossible it is
to fix a line of demarcation between compounds and
syntactical combinations. This is further illustrated
by the fact that much, which in one language is looked
upon as a compound, in another is kept asunder; nay,
in the same language one calls a compound what the
other would count as two distinct words. Thus a
German writes <i>derselbe</i> (= ‘the self,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘the same’)
as one word, whereas an Englishman writes <i>the same</i>;
an Englishman writes <i>himself</i> where the German has,
in two words, <i>sich selbst</i>. Cf. the Eng. <i>long-measure</i>
with the Ger. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">langenmass</i>; the Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malheureux</i> (from
<i>malum augurium</i>, ‘evil omen’) with the Eng. <i>ill-starred</i>,
etc. It is this uncertainty, this vacillation, to
which we owe the compromise of writing such combinations
with a hyphen; e.g., <i>a good-for-nothing</i>.
Though even this usage is not fixed and invariable;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
for one author will write, e.g., <i>head-dress</i>, another
<i>headdress</i>, etc.</p>

<p>If there is no line of logical demarcation between
compound and syntactical groups, no more is there a
phonetic one. Misled by the fact that the words of a
syntactical group are written asunder, and a compound
written as one word, we might think that the members
of such a compound were pronounced as though more
intimately connected than those of a syntactical group.
But combinations like those of article and noun, preposition
and noun, are really pronounced as one continuous
whole as much as any compound. Nor is
there an essential difference in the accent, either in
place or in force. Compare, for instance, <i>with him</i>
and <i>withstand</i> or <i>withdraw</i>; the degree of strength
(or perhaps rather the absence) of emphasis on the
first word in <i>Lord Randolph</i>, <i>Lord Salisbury</i>, with
that on the last ‘syllable’ in <i>landlord</i>; or, again, the
quantity of stress we give to the preposition in the
expression <i>in my opinion</i> with that on the first
syllable of <i>insertion</i>. If the example of <i>Lord Randolph</i>
v. <i>landlord</i> seemed to show that the <small>PLACE</small> of the
accent has some significance, we have but to read the
sentences <i>Not Lord Randolph but Lady R. Churchill</i>,
or <i>Not the landlord but the landlady spoke to the lodger</i>,
to find the accents in exactly the opposite relations and
places. No special place of accent, then, is characteristic
of a compound. A very instructive example we
have in the compound <i>Newfoundland</i>. This is actually
pronounced by various speakers in three different ways:
one says <i>Néwfoundland</i>, another <i>Newfóundland</i>, and,
again, another <i>Newfoundlánd</i>. What, then, makes
every one feel this word, in all three pronunciations,
to be compound? Nothing physiological, but simply
and solely the psychological fact that the meaning of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
the group <i>new-found-land</i> has become specialised, and
no longer corresponds to what once would have been
a perfectly equivalent group, <i>land-newly-discovered</i>.
Semasiological development and isolation is the criterion
of a compound. What degree of such isolation is
required cannot be stated in any hard and fast rule.</p>

<p>Such isolation can be effected in four different ways.
(1) In the first place, the whole group, as such, can
develop its meaning in a manner, or to a degree, not
shared by the compound members. An example of
this we saw just now in <i>Newfoundland</i>. (2) Or, again,
the component parts, as separate words, may develop
and change their meaning, without being followed in
that development by the same words as part of the
group. Thus, e.g., <i>with</i> originally meant <i>against</i>.
This meaning it still has in <i>withstand</i>, whilst as a
separate word it is not now used in that meaning.
(3) Thirdly, the compound parts may become obsolete
as separate words; as, for instance, <i>ric</i> in ‘bishopric’
(cf. supra, p. 317). (4) And lastly, the peculiar construction
according to which the parts are connected
or combined may become obsolete, surviving only in
the formula, which thus becomes isolated. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>,
the genitive singular of feminine nouns can no longer
be formed without <i>s</i>; hence <i>Lady-day</i> is now felt as a
compound word, whilst <i>ladies’-cloak</i> or <i>ladies’-house</i>
would not be so felt.</p>

<p>Though such isolation is necessary and may suffice
to stamp a group as compound, we must not conclude
that every group, where such isolation in one way or
another has commenced, is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> looked upon as a
compound. Many considerations are here of importance,
some of which will be brought out in a further
study of some examples in which we can observe the
commencement of the fusion.</p>

<p>The first step which a syntactical group takes on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the road towards complete isolation and consequent
fusion into a compound, is commonly the one we
described under No. 1. in the former section. We must
here distinguish two cases, which, though perhaps not
easily distinguished <i>in words</i>, are yet clearly different.</p>

<p>An example will best serve to explain it. We have
already more than once stated that in <i>Lady-day</i> the
grammatical isolation of the genitive <i>lady</i>, as against the
present genitive <i>lady’s</i>, serves to emphasise the fusion
of the two parts into one compound. But we must not
forget that this form of the genitive in this combination
would not have been preserved if, at the time when the
word <i>lady</i> by itself began to assume the genitive <i>s</i>&mdash;or,
rather, began to follow analogically other genitives in
<i>s</i>,&mdash;if, we say, the compound had not then already been
isolated to a sufficient degree to protect the first component
part against the influence which affected it when
standing in other combinations. The absence of the <i>s</i>
is therefore <small>NOT</small> the <small>CAUSE</small> of the isolation of the group,
or the fusion of its parts. We must seek for that cause
most likely in the fact that the genitive was, in this
combination, used in a sense which always was or had
become unusual. <i>Lady-day</i>, even when the form <i>lady</i>
was still felt as genitive, would but mean ‘the day
consecrated to the service of our Lady,’ or ‘the day
sacred to our Lady.’ Now this use of the genitive
must always have been an exceptional one. Never,
for instance, could <i>a man’s book</i> or <i>a lady’s cloak</i> have
had a similar meaning. It was therefore at first not
so much the meaning of the component parts, as the
<small>MEANING EXPRESSED BY THEIR SYNTACTICAL CO-ORDINATION</small>,
which stood apart and became isolated. We see
something of the same influence if we compare <i>St.
John’s wood</i> and <i>St. John’s Church</i>. In the second group,
the latter of the component parts has a meaning which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
suggests and helps to keep alive the correct meaning
of the genitive-relation expressed by the flection of the
former part. In <i>St. John’s wood</i> this is not so. This
compound is therefore felt to be more intimately fused
together than the other, and, while every one who uses
the expression <i>St. John’s Church</i> thinks of the Saint
who bore the name of <i>John</i>, but few speakers will do
so in speaking of <i>St. John’s wood</i>. There is a very
clear instance of this at hand in the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hungersnot</i>,
lit. = <i>hungersneed</i>, i.e. ‘<i>famine</i>’ (need, suffering <i>caused
by</i> hunger). Here the genitive with the word <i>need</i> has
a very special sense, which, <i>e.g.</i>, could not be expressed
by the otherwise equivalent construction with <i>of</i>. ‘The
need of hunger,’ if ever used in German, would be a
very forced and uncommon way of expressing the idea
‘famine,’ a way which only a poet could adopt (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Not
des Hungers</i>). Here, then, again, it is not the sense of
the words, but the sense of their syntactical relation
which stands isolated.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we consider forms like
<i>upstairs</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>altogether</i>, we shall find that it is not
this relation, but the whole meaning of the group as
such, which has become isolated by development or
specialisation of meaning. <i>Upstairs</i> has become equivalent
to ‘on a floor of the building higher than we are
now;’ <i>always</i> has been extended so as to include the
relation of time, etc. This development has then
generally given rise to what grammarians term ‘indeclinabilia,’
which sometimes, by secondary development
have become capable of flection. Thus the German
preposition <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zu</i> (to, at), and the dative case <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">frieden</i>
(peace), in a sentence like <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich bin zufrieden</i>, gave rise
to the compound <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zufrieden</i> (lit. = ‘at peace’), ‘contented.’
When once the prepositional phrase <i>at peace</i> had developed
into the adjective <i>content</i>, the compound was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
declined like other adjectives: <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein zufriedener mann</i> =
‘a contented man;’ etc.</p>

<p>Again, when the groups <i>round-about</i> and <i>go-between</i>
had become nouns, they could be treated as such, and
we find the plurals <i>round-abouts</i> and <i>go-betweens</i>.</p>

<p>The more highly a language is inflected, the less
liable will the parts of a syntactical group be to fuse
into one. It is much easier for a combination like
<i>Greenland</i> or <i>Newfoundland</i> to pass into a real compound
than for one like the German <i>(das) rote Meer</i>,
‘(the) Red Sea,’ though the amount of isolation of
meaning is the same in both. Whether the group
<i>Green</i> + <i>land</i> is nominative or dative or genitive, no
change in the form of <i>green</i> occurs; in German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das
rote Meer</i> is nominative, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">des roten Meeres</i> is genitive,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">dem roten Meer</i> is dative. Every time one of the
two latter cases is used, the addition of the flection <i>n</i>
reminds us of the independence of the two words <i>rot</i>
and <i>Meer</i>.</p>

<p>Just as by means of suffixes, etc., we derive new
words from others, whether the latter are simple or
compound forms (<i>love</i>, <i>love-able</i>; <i>for-get</i>, <i>forget-able</i>;
etc.), so we sometimes find whole syntactical groups,
which are not yet considered as having been fused
into one compound, used with similar suffixes. Instances
are: <i>good-for-nothingness</i>, <i>a stand-off-ishness</i>, <i>a
devil-may-carish face</i>; <i>That fellow is such a go-a-header</i>;
<i>He is not get-at-able</i>, etc., which no doubt scarcely
belong to the literary language, but which show that
the linguistic feeling of the speaker must have already
apprehended these groups as unities; in other words,
that the first step on the road towards welding them
into a compound has been taken. A well-established
instance appears in our ordinal numerals, such as <i>one-and-twentieth</i>,
<i>five-and-fortieth</i>, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>A similar commencement of fusion we can observe
in copulative combinations like <i>wind and weather</i> or
<i>town and country</i>, as soon as the whole may be conceived
as a single conception. In <i>wind and weather</i>
this is the case, the two terms being in this combination
<small>SYNONYMOUS</small>, describing the same object from
different points of view. Other instances of this we
have in <i>bag and baggage</i>, <i>kith and kin</i>, <i>moil and toil</i>,
<i>safe and sound</i>, <i>first and foremost</i>, <i>house and home</i>, <i>far
and wide</i>.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> In <i>town and country</i>, on the other hand, we
have two elements which, whilst <small>CONTRASTING</small>, supplement
one another. Such groups are <i>old and young</i>,
<i>heaven and hell</i>, <i>gown and town</i>, <i>big and small</i>, <i>rich
and poor</i>, <i>hither and thither</i>, <i>to and fro</i>, <i>up and down</i>,
<i>in and out</i>. In a few, the same member is repeated;
as, <i>out and out</i>, <i>through and through</i>, <i>again and again</i>,
<i>little by little</i>. A careful consideration of the real
meaning of such groups will show that, strictly speaking,
these form a subdivision of our second class.</p>

<p>Inflected languages like German afford a criterion
not applicable to English, as to the fusion of such
combinations. We find there, for instance, a group&mdash;<i>Habe
und Gut</i> (Etymol. = <i>have</i>, as a noun, for
‘property,’ <i>and good</i> = ‘chattels’), for ‘all a man’s
possessions.’ The first of these nouns is feminine,
and consequently ‘with all (his) belongings’ would be
‘mit all<i>er</i> Habe;’ <i>Gut</i>, on the other hand, is neuter,
and requires the form (dative after <i>mit</i>) ‘mit all<i>em</i>
Gut.’ Goethe has treated the group <i>Hab’ und Gut</i> as
a neuter noun, and written ‘mit all<i>em</i> mobilen Hab’
und Gut’ (‘with all movable possessions’).</p>

<p>We have seen that groups like <i>one and twenty</i>, <i>five
and forty</i>, etc., were really far advanced on the way of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
fusion, as was shown by the formation of the corresponding
ordinals. In the case of those which begin
with <i>one</i>, we have a further proof of this in the use of
the plural noun, <i>e.g.</i> ‘one and twenty <i>men</i>.’</p>

<p>It will be readily felt that in expressions like <i>a
black and white dog</i>, the group <i>black and white</i> really
is in a similar state of fusion. We have but to separate
the parts into two really independent words by the
insertion of a second indefinite article, to see at once
that ‘black and white’ is the description of <i>one</i>
quality of <i>one</i> object, a compound word to express one
(though not psychologically simple) conception.</p>

<p>So, again, the group <i>one and all</i> is sufficiently
welded into one to resist, <i>e.g.</i>, the insertion of the
preposition <i>of</i> before its second part. Thus we should
say <i>It was for the good of one and all</i> (i.e. for the
entire community) and not <i>of one and of all</i>.</p>

<p>We may assume that complete fusion between the
parts of such copulative groups would be more common
if it were not checked by the connecting particle <i>and</i>.
In some of the most common of these the accent of
<i>and</i> has become so much depressed that the word
becomes almost inaudible: cf. <i>hare and hounds</i>, <i>half
and half</i>, etc. In combinations where the connecting
particle has become unrecognisable in consequence of
such phonetic sinking, it no longer resists the fusion.
Thus, <i>Jackanapes</i> has become to all intents and
purposes one word. It stands<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> with the common
preposition <i>on</i>, instead of <i>of</i> (cf. the very frequent use
of this ‘on’ in Shakespeare and contemporaries), for
<i>Jack-of-apes</i>, i.e., originally, ‘the man of the (<i>or</i> with
the) [performing] apes,’ just as <i>Jack-a-lantern</i> stands
for ‘Jack of the (<i>or</i> with the) lantern,’ etc. Combinations
without any such connecting link pass, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
all the more easily into compounds: cf. <i>Alsace-Lorraine</i>,
as against such combinations as <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>.</p>

<p>In the period of the Indo-European languages before
inflections had taken their rise, or when they were
not yet indispensable, the fusion into a ‘copulative
compound’ (dvand-va) must have been simple and easy.</p>

<p>When a substantive has been <i>specialised</i> in meaning
by being combined with an attributive, as <i>blackbird</i>,
the combination may pass through all the changes
of signification described in Chapter IV. without the
uncombined substantive as such being affected. The
result is commonly to make the combination richer in
contents than the simple combination of the parts.
Thus, by ‘a blackbird’ we understand the familiar
songster to which we give the name, and no longer
understand such birds as rooks, crows, etc., which
<i>might</i> have been classed under the name ‘blackbird.’<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
Further modifications may set in, which may cause
the epithet, strictly interpreted, to become wholly
inapplicable. Thus, ‘a butterfly’<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> is applied to a
whole class of insects quite irrespective of their colours.
When we talk of the Middle Ages, we mean a strictly
defined period of time, though no such definition is
involved in the word <i>middle</i>. <i>Privy Councillor</i> denotes
a definite rank; and the idea of privacy hardly enters
into our heads as we pronounce the word: cf. also
such expressions as <i>the Holy Scriptures</i>; <i>the fine
Arts</i>; <i>cold blood</i>; <i>Black Monday</i>; <i>Passion Week</i>;
<i>the High School</i>; <i>the wise men from the East</i>. It
must be observed that the substantival determinants
are only able to fuse with the word defined if they are
employed in an abstract sense. This restriction does
not, however, apply in the case of proper names.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>A subdivision of this great class of words, thus
<i>specialised</i>, is formed by common place-names which
have become proper nouns by the aid of some determinant,
itself possibly also unspecific. Such are <i>the
Red Sea</i>, <i>the Black Forest</i>, <i>Broadway</i>, <i>the Sublime
Porte</i>, <i>the Watergate</i>, <i>the Blue Mountains</i>, <i>High
Town</i>, <i>Beechwood</i>, <i>Broadmeadows</i>, <i>Coldstream</i>, <i>Troutbeck</i>,
<i>Dog-island</i>. It is similar, too, when an epithet
attached as a distinguishing mark to a proper name
comes to be apprehended as an integral portion of the
proper name&mdash;in fact, as attaching to the individual;
as, <i>Richard the Humpback</i>, <i>Charles the Bald</i>, <i>William
the Conqueror</i>, <i>Alexandra Land</i>, <i>the Mackenzie River</i>,
<i>Weston-super-mare</i>.</p>

<p>Compare also such compounds as <i>Oldham</i>, <i>Littleton</i>,
<i>Hightown</i>, <i>Lower-Austria</i>, <i>Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p>The metaphorical application of a word is generally
rendered intelligible by the context; especially and
chiefly by the addition of a determinant: cf. ‘the <i>head</i>
of the conspirators;’ ‘the <i>heart</i> of the enterprise;’
‘the <i>life</i> of the undertaking;’ ‘the <i>sting</i> of death.’
Similarly, a determinant forming an element in a compound
helps to render the metaphorical application
intelligible; indeed, we are able by the aid of such a
determinant to give to compounds a metaphorical
sense, which we could hardly venture upon for the
undetermined word alone: so, for instance, we give
the name of <i>German-silver</i> to a material which we
should not call merely <i>silver</i>; the name of <i>sea-horse</i> to
what we would not call <i>a horse</i>: cf. further, <i>sea-cow</i>,
<i>elder-wine</i>, <i>ginger-beer</i>, etc.</p>

<p>There are some cases, again, in which the compound
has a proper, as well as a metaphorical meaning,
and only as a compound acquires its metaphorical
use: such are <i>swallow-tail</i>, <i>negro-head</i>, <i>mothers’ joy</i>,
<i>cuckoo-spittle</i>, <i>woolly bear</i>, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>We have now to consider how syntactical and
formal isolation contributes to further the fusion of
the determinant with the determinate. If we compare
two combinations such as <i>kinsman</i> with <i>man-of-war</i>,
or <i>man of deeds</i>, we shall find that whilst the one has
become an undoubted composition, the others are still
groups of more or less independent parts. This is of
course due to the fact that even now the word <i>man</i> is
inflected, and that consequently the plurals, <i>men of
war</i> and <i>men of deeds</i>, remind us of the fact that the
first member of the group is an independent word.
Formerly, when the flection was far more elaborate,
this was, naturally, much more the case, and this alone
would have sufficed to establish the feeling that, in
compounds, the genitive which remained the same in
all ‘cases’ of the compound had to precede. Of
course, as long as flection sufficiently indicated the
cases, both orders <i>could</i> be used in any group, but as
then only such groups in which the genitive <i>did</i> precede
became ‘compounds,’ those compounds became
models, and the practice arose gradually and gradually
became a <i>rule</i>. Another force then came to exert its
influence in the same direction. In such genitival
combinations it is, as a rule, the genitive which has
the accent. When, then, this genitive was placed
first, the whole group thereby resembled in accent
the existing composites of the oldest formation, and
so was more easily considered in the same light as
these. The main cause must, however, be sought in
a syntactical isolation, <i>i.e.</i>, in our examples, an isolation
in the construction of the article. As long as flectional
terminations existed in their entirety, the Teutonic
languages could dispense with the article before declined
cases of nouns; in fact we may say the article
did not exist, the demonstrative pronoun not yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
having been degraded into what it became later on&mdash;a
mere sign of case. Hence it was in old Teutonic
languages quite possible, and a frequent practice, to
use the genitive case of a noun alone without an
article at all. We may be sure that this has also
been true for the other cases. Phonetic decay, however,
levelled the terminations of the other cases of a
noun long before the genitive; and accusative and dative
had long been alike (or very nearly so) at a time when
in the masculine and neuter singular the genitive <i>s</i> was
still preserved: in fact, as we know, in English it is all
that has remained to us of the old flectional endings,
with the exception of those <i>s</i>’s, in the plural which are
original and not due to analogy. In that older stage of
the language it was common to express an idea like <i>the
son of man</i> by constructions just as in Ancient Greek,
where the genitive stood between the article and the
noun, which were both, of course, in the same case.
Thus we find in Old High German, <i>ther</i> (<small>NOM. SING.</small>
masc.) <i>mannes sun</i> (= ‘the man’s son’<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>). In Anglo-Saxon,
<i>Heofona rice ys gelíc ðám hiredes ealdre</i> (‘of
heaven’s (the) Kingdom is like the (<small>DAT.</small> sing.) household’s
prince’). Gradually, however, the use of a
noun without the article, largely, no doubt, owing to
the levelling of all other cases, became more and
more rare even in the genitive. Such rare standing
expressions as remained without article, naturally assumed
the appearance of compounds, and, especially in
the case where the article belonging to the second
noun preceded the genitive, the fusion was complete:
<i>the</i> + <i>kin’s</i> + <i>man</i> became <i>the</i> + <i>kinsman</i>.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>We have already pointed out how the adjective
and the noun entered into composition, and seen how,
even in many combinations which we are not yet
accustomed to look upon as fused into one, derivatives
show that this fusion has at least partly been
accomplished. Such are the many forms in <i>ed</i>, like
<i>black-eyed</i>, etc., which are derived from the groups
<i>black eye</i>, etc., and cannot be looked upon as compounds
of <i>black</i> + <i>eyed</i>. We do not speak of an <i>eyed</i>
person, for one who has eyes: cf. <i>left-handed</i>, <i>self-willed</i>,
<i>one-handed</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In English, especially in Scottish dialects, many
adverbs which commonly follow the verb, are occasionally
made to precede it; as, <i>to uplift</i>, <i>to backslide</i>,
etc. We may gather that in such forms no composition
strictly so called has as yet set in, from the fact that
the order is frequently transposed, as in <i>sliding back</i>, <i>to
lift up</i>, etc. On the other hand, the fact that the words
are joined in writing shows that the whole has begun
to be apprehended as a unity.</p>

<p>In the case of most of these combinations we can
trace the commencement of an isolation, which proves
that the linguistic sense is ceasing to apprehend the
elements as distinct. For instance, in English the old
prepositional adverbs cannot be used independently
and freely to form new combinations at will, but are
confined to a definite group of combinations. Thus
we can say, <i>enfold</i> and <i>entwine</i>: but not <i>enthrow</i>, for
<i>throw in</i>. We can talk of <i>onset</i>, and <i>onslaught</i>, but not
of <i>on-run</i>: of <i>overflow</i>, but not of <i>over-pour</i>. In many
cases this isolation has led to a special development of
meaning, and the word becomes still more definitely
a compound; cf. such words as <i>inroad</i>, <i>after-birth</i>,
<i>offset</i>, <i>over-coat</i>. From the union of the verb with the
adverb, there arise nominal derivatives in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
sense is yet more specialised, such as <i>offset</i>, <i>output</i>,
<i>offal</i>, <i>under-writer</i>.</p>

<p>An adverb derived from an adjective sometimes
fuses with the nominal forms of the verb. The first
impulse to this fusion is often given by the metaphorical
application of one part of the compound: cf. <i>deep-feeling</i>,
<i>far-reaching</i>, <i>high-flying</i>. The combination
becomes even closer when the first part retains a
meaning which has become unusual to it in general.
For instance, in such a combination as <i>ill-favoured</i>, <i>ill</i>
retains a trace of the time when it could be used as
synonymous with <i>bad</i>.</p>

<p>In German, the comparative and superlative forms
are actually used, showing the completeness of the
fusion; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der tieffühlendste Geist</i> (Goethe), (lit. =
‘deep-feelingest ghost,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘spirit’).</p>

<p>There are a few combinations of verbal-forms with
an object accusative, which similarly occupy an intermediate
position between the compound and the syntactic
group; such as <i>laughter-provoking</i>, <i>wrath-stirring</i>,
<i>fire-spitting</i>. No sharp line can be drawn between
these instances of spontaneous and natural fusion, and
the analogical formations coined by the poets; as <i>sea-encompassed</i>,
<i>storm-tossed</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Again, and even in English, where the application
of the inflected comparative and superlative is of so
very limited application, it is the use of the comparative
or superlative which affords a test as to the degree of
fusion. It is, of course, possible to analyse <i>most
laughter-provoking</i>, as <i>provoking much laughter</i>. But
few would adopt such an explanation in a sentence
like <i>This is the most fire-spitting speech I ever heard</i>.</p>

<p>Besides this, there are many verbal combinations
which must be apprehended as compounds, from the
fact that they represent a single notion only; such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
<i>with regard to</i>, <i>as soon as possible</i>, <i>forasmuch as</i>,
<i>seeing that</i>, <i>none the less</i>,&mdash;which must be considered to
stand on the same footing as <i>notwithstanding</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>.
This fusion is sometimes accompanied by a
displacement of the psychological conception as to the
parts of the sentence, whereby the natural mode of
construction is altered, and the combination performs
a new function, and becomes practically a different
part of speech. For instance, we commonly hear <i>I as
good as promised it to them</i>, where ‘as good as’ is
nearly equivalent to ‘almost,’ and is construed like that
adverb. We even meet with sentences like <i>unclassified
and prize-cattle</i>, where a member of a compound is
placed on the same footing as an independent word.
Moreover, the first, or determinant member of the
compound may be followed by determinants, as if it
were itself independent; thus Milton can write <i>hopeless
to circumvent us</i>; <i>fearless to be overmatched</i>: as if it had
been ‘without hope to circumvent us;’ ‘having no
fear to be overmatched.’ All this shows over and
over again how completely impossible it is to draw the
line between syntactical groups and compounds.</p>

<p>In this manner, then, syntactical isolation favours
the fusion of a group into a compound. In our
discussion of the form <i>Jackanapes</i>, we had already
an instance how phonetic changes may have the same
effect. This we shall now investigate and illustrate
rather more in detail.</p>

<p>Though it would be impossible to prove the fact
historically, it seems involved in the nature of the case
that, for the most part, such phonetic changes at first
arose in <small>EVERY</small> case of such closer and more intimate
syntactical union; that they were re-adjusted and
re-equalised later on, and were only preserved in
groupings which, as a consequence of development of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
meaning, had become so far fused into one whole as
to be capable of resisting the re-adjusting tendencies.</p>

<p>The simplest of such general effects of syntactical
grouping is that the final consonant of a syllable is
transferred in pronunciation to the next syllable. Thus,
for instance, <i>an apple</i> is pronounced <i>a-napple</i>, without
any pause; <i>here</i> + <i>on</i> is pronounced <i>he</i> + <i>ron</i>, etc. If,
then, as in French, this final consonant disappears
from pronunciation, save when thus made an initial, <i>i.e.</i>
save before a word beginning with a vowel, we may
expect its presence to have an isolating effect, and
consequently to be sufficient to stamp the group as a
compound. This, however, is only the case if such a
preservation is not sufficiently frequent to be realised
as a rule of pronunciation for all similar cases. In
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il peut</i> = ‘he can,’ is pronounced without the
<i>t</i>; in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être</i> = ‘may be,’ ‘perhaps,’ the <i>t</i> is heard.
Yet this has not isolated the form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut</i> with <i>t</i> from the
usual third person singular present indicative without
<i>t</i>, because this <i>t</i> is preserved not in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être</i> alone, or
in a few such groups, but in <i>all</i> cases where the following
word begins with a vowel; e.g., <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il peut avoir</i> = ‘he
can (may) have,’ pronounced with the <i>t</i> likewise. If
we suppose the French language to discard at some
time this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i>, as it is called, and always to pronounce
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut</i> without <i>t</i> even before vowels, then, and not till
then, would the pronunciation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être</i> with <i>t</i> stamp
the combination as a compound.</p>

<p>So, again, the well-known process of avoiding
<i>hiatus</i> by contraction or elision, in the case of a word
ending in a vowel preceding one that begins with a
vowel, has been sufficient to fuse two elements into
one compound in many cases (e.g., <i>about</i> = a + be +
ut (an); Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnopere</i> = <i>magno</i> + <i>opere</i>; Gothic <i>sah</i>,
‘this’ = <i>sa</i> + <i>uh</i>), but has no such effect in the case of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
the French article, or of the French preposition <i>de</i>,
because the elision of the unaccented <i>e</i> and <i>a</i> is there
an almost invariable and still ‘living’ rule.</p>

<p>A third general effect of close syntactical combination
is the assimilation of a final and initial consonant.
This, in present European languages, is scarcely, if at
all, noticed or expressed <i>in writing</i>. It is, however,
an exceedingly common occurrence in the <i>spoken</i> language,
a fact of which every one can and ought to
convince himself by a little attention to his own and
other’s <small>NATURAL</small> pronunciation. It is only in cases
where further reasons, in addition to this assimilation,
such as, <i>e.g.</i>, isolation by development of meaning or
other phonetic development, have welded the group
into a compound, or at least have advanced it a considerable
distance on the road towards complete fusion,
that the written language sometimes takes cognisance
of the change, and, by the very spelling, indicates the
compound nature of the group. We say ‘sometimes’
takes cognisance; for while spelling in no living language
follows all the variations in pronunciation, no European
tongue is further from accurately representing the
spoken&mdash;that is, the real&mdash;language in its writing than
English. Hence the instances even of acknowledged
compounds, in which the assimilation in sound is indicated
by the spelling, are comparatively rare. Such
are <i>gossib</i>, for <i>god</i> + <i>sib</i> = ‘sib, or related, in God;’
<i>leoman</i>, for <i>leof</i> + <i>man</i> = ‘dear man;’ <i>quagmire</i> = <i>quakemire</i>,
i.e. ‘quaking mire.’ Instances where the assimilation
exists in pronunciation, but is <i>not</i> represented in
writing, are plentiful: <i>cupboard</i>, pronounced <i>cub-board</i>
(or <i>cubberd</i>); <i>blackguard</i>, pronounced <i>blagguard</i>, etc.
In all these we must, on the one hand, admit with
respect to the recognition of the group as compound,
that, even if it has not promoted assimilation, it has at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
least checked the tendency to restore the theoretically
correct pronunciation of the final consonant of the
former member in each group. On the other hand,
however, it is as certain that the very facility thus
afforded to the working of the assimilating tendency
has aided the phonetic isolation of the group and
promoted the fusion.</p>

<p>The most effective cause of phonetic isolation,
however, lies of course in the influence of accent.
This has been sufficiently illustrated in the course of
the foregoing discussions.</p>

<p>In all these discussions we have mainly regarded
the transition of a syntactical group into a compound.
Several of our examples, however, well illustrate the
fact that, just as the fusion between the two members
of some group may be insufficient to stamp the combination
as a compound, so, also, such a compound
loses its character as such for the consciousness of all
but the student of language, when the fusion proceeds
too far. The compound then becomes, to all intents
and purposes, a simple word; it serves no more as
model for analogical compounds with the same members,
and at the very most gives the impression of
having been ‘derived’ from its first member by a
suffix. To instance this, we need only recall a few
of our examples to the reader’s mind&mdash;<i>bandog</i>, <i>auger</i>,
<i>furlong</i>, etc., or (with the suffixes) <i>bishopric</i>, <i>kingdom</i>, etc.</p>

<p>A careful study of these and similar examples will
show that in the first-class of compounds, no longer
recognised as such, sometimes both members have become
obsolete, and in both classes almost always one.</p>

<p>We have now reached a point whence we can
observe the conditions necessary to give birth to a
suffix, or, if the phrase be preferred, necessary to
degrade an independent word into a suffix.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>We have seen a suffix originate in a noun which
either (as in a case of ‘<i>-ric</i>’) became obsolete as an
independent word, or whose connection with the
etymologically identical independent form ceased to
be felt in the linguistic consciousness of the community.</p>

<p>But such a fate may and does often befall a word
without converting it into an acknowledged suffix. It
has befallen the noun <i>ðyrl</i> (‘a hole’), in <i>nostril</i> (= <i>nose-thirl</i>),
or the word <i>búr</i> (‘a dweller’) in <i>neighbour</i> (‘a
near-dweller’), and yet neither <i>-tril</i> nor <i>-bour</i> have
become recognised as suffixes in the English language.</p>

<p>What more, then, is required?</p>

<p>First of all, the first element must be etymologically
perfectly clear; cf. <i>kingdom</i>, <i>bishopric</i> as against <i>nos-tril</i>,
<i>gos-sip</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the second element must not occur in
one or two combinations only, but in a sufficiently
large group of words, in all of which it modifies the
meaning of the first member in the same way; cf. <i>nos-tril</i>,
<i>gos-sip</i>, as against ‘king<i>dom</i>,’ ‘widow<i>hood</i>.’</p>

<p>This second condition can scarcely be fulfilled
except in cases where&mdash;</p>

<p>Thirdly, the second element has originally, or in its
combination with the others, some such abstract and
general meaning as <i>state</i>, <i>condition</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>action</i>, etc.</p>

<p>A few words on one of the best-known suffixes in
English will make this clear. Though the phrase would
hardly stand in written or literary language, we <i>might</i>
indicate a dealer in pianos as the <i>piano-man</i>, i.e. ‘the
man who has pianos.’ In the oldest stages of language,
not only could a single noun be thus used with an
almost adjectival force, but even a compound (or what
was then still a syntactical co-ordination) of two or
more nouns, or of adjective and noun, could be
thus employed. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, in Sanscrit, a <i>much-rice-king</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
would mean ‘a king who possesses much rice,’
<i>i.e.</i> ‘is rich;’ and the group <i>man-shape</i> (or its equivalent)
might have been used for <i>man-shape-having</i>.
Such compounds abound in Sanscrit, and could be
formed at will. They were called <i>Bahuvrîhi</i> compounds.
Now, without of course wishing to assert
that the very combination <i>man-ly</i> is an original one,
it is to such a combination of a noun with the <i>noun</i>
which afterwards became <i>lic</i> in Anglo-Saxon that we
owe the suffix <i>ly</i>. The phonetic differentiation and
the development of meaning from <i>shape-having</i> to
<i>appearance</i> or <i>quality-having</i>, isolated the member
from its corresponding independent form (which in
German and Dutch still exists as <i>Leiche</i> and <i>Lyk</i> =
<i>body</i> or <i>corpse</i>), and gave us <i>lic</i> (later <i>ly</i>) as a suffix.</p>

<p>From all that we have said it must be clear that
this process has gone on neither in prehistoric nor
in historic times only, but is one which is repeated
again and again, and consequently&mdash;seeing that prehistoric
times are of unknown, but certainly enormous
length&mdash;we must be on our guard against assuming
that all these prototypes of Indo-Germanic suffixes
must necessarily have existed at one time as independent
words in the language, before the process
which transformed them into suffixes began to operate.
We may, nay, we are almost compelled to assume
that there, too, they arose in succession, and that then
as now, whenever phonetic decay or other causes had
affected a suffix to such an extent as to take away the
appearance of a derivative from what was once a compound,
the suffix was no longer felt as such; it ceased
to serve for new combinations, and another more
weighty suffix took its function and supplanted it in
all but a few remaining cases.</p>

<p>The most superficial knowledge of any modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
language, or of Latin etymology, is sufficient to show
that it is as impossible to draw a line between suffix
and flectional termination, as between syntactical group
and compound. Even a Frenchman, unless he has
had the true historical explanation pointed out to him,
feels in a future tense like <i>j’aimerai</i>, a verb-stem <i>aim</i>,
and a termination <i>-erai</i> indicative of futurity, though,
nowadays, there are but few students of French
grammar who ignore the fact that <i>aimerai</i> is a compound
of the infinitive <i>aimer</i> and the first person
singular, present, indicative, <i>ai</i> = (I) <i>have</i>. Similarly,
we may safely assume that few Romans felt in a
pluperfect <i>amaveram</i> a perfect stem <i>amav</i> and <i>eram</i>
the imperfect of <i>sum</i>, much less in <i>amabo</i> a present
stem <i>ama</i> and a suffix derived from the same root as
their perfect <i>fu-i</i>. It is certainly useless to illustrate
this further.</p>

<p>We may now conclude with three observations, the
truth of which will be apparent from what has gone
before.</p>

<p>First. Even when an inflected form, by means of
comparative study of all its oldest forms and equivalents
in cognate languages, has been brought back to
its prototype, and analysed into what are commonly
considered to be its component parts, we must
remember that these parts cannot have been fused
into the integer which we now find made up of them,
and yet have retained their original form and original
meaning. Just as <i>kingdoms</i> has certainly not arisen
from <i>king</i> + <i>dom</i> + <i>s</i>, a Greek optative <i>pherois</i> is not
a compound of <i>pher</i> + <i>o</i> + <i>i</i> + <i>s</i>, though, undoubtedly,
each of these elements have their regular representatives
in other words of the same function, and most
probably had their prototypes in fuller forms, in a
more independent state. We have no means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
knowing what these forms were, or what their original
function was when still independent.</p>

<p>Second. Many words which we now consider as
“simple” may have been compound or derivative. Our
inability to further analyse does not prove primitive
unity.</p>

<p>Third. In the history of Indo-European flection
we do wrong if we assume the separate existence of
a period of construction and one of decay.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE DIVISION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.</span></h2>

<p>The division commonly adopted of the parts of
speech in the Indo-European language is convenient
as a classification; but it must be borne in mind that it
is not logically accurate, nor is it exhaustive. It is
indeed impossible to divide words into sharply defined
categories, seeing that, however we may divide them,
we shall find it difficult to exclude some from each
category which may fairly claim to be registered under
some other category or categories, basing their claim
upon at least certain uses.</p>

<p>The accepted grammatical categories have had
their form determined mainly by the consideration of
three points: (1) by the meaning of each word taken
by itself; (2) by its function in the sentence; (3) by its
capacity for inflection, and the part it plays in word-formation.</p>

<p>As regards the meaning of the word, we may
notice that the grammatical categories of substantive,
adjective, and verb correspond to the logical categories
of <i>substance</i>, <i>quality</i>, and <i>activity</i>, or, more properly,
<i>occurrence</i>. But here, at the outset, we find that
the substantive is not confined to the denotation of
substance, as there are also substantives denoting
quality and occurrence as, ‘brightness,’ a ‘rise.’ There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
are also verbs which denote continuous states and
qualities; as, ‘to remain,’ or the Latin ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cande</i>’ = ‘to be
white.’ Pronouns and numerals again have a right on
the score of meaning to be separated as classes from
substantives and adjectives: but these, again, must be
separated from each other in their substantival as
against adjectival use (e.g. <i>each</i> as against <i>each man</i>;
<i>Six went and six stayed</i> as against <i>Six men, etc.</i>; <i>this
and that</i> as against <i>this book and that one</i>), which forbids
us to simply co-ordinate the classes: substantive, adjective,
pronoun, numerals. And, on the other hand, it
must follow that, if pronouns and numerals are to be
regarded as distinct species of the noun class, the same
separation must be extended to the adverb class: since
<i>badly</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>twice</i>, are related to each other just as <i>bad</i>,
<i>this</i>, <i>two</i>.</p>

<p>To come to the connecting words. The lines that
define the class of the conjunctions are quite arbitrary;
<i>where</i>, for instance, is called an adverb even in
passages like this:<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> “<i>Where</i>, in former times, the only
remedy for misgovernment real or supposed was a
change of dynasty, the evil is now corrected at no
greater cost than a ministerial crisis.” <i>As</i> and <i>while</i>,
again, are called conjunctions. In the simple sentence,
the test usually applied to distinguish prepositions
from conjunctions is case-government. But it certainly
is entirely illogical to call words like <i>before</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>after</i>
prepositions when they occur in simple sentences, and to
call them conjunctions when they connect sentences;&mdash;for
this function is in both cases exactly the same; cf.
<i>before my interview with you</i>, and <i>before I saw you</i>.</p>

<p>If we wished to classify words according to their
function in the sentence, it might seem obvious to
divide words (1) into those which can <i>of themselves</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
form a sentence, (2) into those which can serve <i>as
members</i> of a sentence, and (3) those which can only
<i>serve to connect</i> such members.</p>

<p>In the first division we might, then, place the interjections,
which, when isolated, are really imperfect
sentences. But these also occur as members of a
sentence, sometimes with and sometimes without a
preposition; as, <i>Woe to the land!</i> <i>Out on thee!</i> <i>Oh my!</i></p>

<p>The finite verb in its original use better fulfils the
idea of a perfect sentence. But in its present use it
appears&mdash;if we except the imperative&mdash;as a mere predicate
attached to a subject separately denoted. And
the so-called auxiliaries are mainly used as mere connecting
words.</p>

<p>Connecting words, again, such as conjunctions and
prepositions, are, as we have seen, derived from independent
words by a displacement as to the appreciation
of the part which a word plays in a sentence (cf. Chap.
XVI., pp. 282 and 284.). Such words are <i>during</i>, <i>in
regard to</i>, <i>notwithstanding</i>. And there is this further
reason why they cannot be sharply distinguished from
other kinds of words&mdash;that a word may be an independent
member of the particular sentence to which it belongs,
and yet at the same time serve to connect this with
another sentence. If I say, for instance, <i>The man who
believes this is a fool</i>, the <i>who</i> is at once an independent
member of the relative sentence and a connecting word
between the principal and subordinate sentence. This
is universally the case as regards the relative pronoun
and relative adverb. It is true also of the demonstrative
when this refers to the preceding or following
sentence; as, <i>I saw a man</i>, <i>he told me</i>, etc. But even if
this first classification as to function could be consistently
carried out, any further attempt at subdivision
leads us into fresh difficulties, considering that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
substantive, as opposed to the adjective and verb, is
the part of speech which serves as subject and object.
We might, indeed, be tempted to utilize this fact as
the principle of our subclassification. But we find in
the first place that a substantive can also be used
attributively and predicatively, like an adjective (cf.
<i>We are men</i>, <i>We are manly</i>), and, on the other hand,
other words may serve as the subject in such sentences
as <i>Well begun is half ended</i>; <i>Slow and steady wins
the race</i>; <i>Finished is finished</i>. An adjective, too, may
serve as object; as, <i>He takes good for bad</i>; <i>Write it
down, black on white</i>; <i>to make bad worse</i>.</p>

<p>We have indeed seen that the use of prepositions
to introduce subordinate sentences is very common in
English; as, <i>After he had begotten Seth</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The division which can be most systematically
carried out is that which divides words according as
they are inflected or not, and according to their mode
of flection. In this way three convenient divisions
may be made of nouns, verbs, and uninflected words.
But even here the nominal forms of the verb, such as
the infinitive, <i>to love</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amare</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lieben</i>) and indeclinable
substantives such as the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornu</i> and the English
adjectives, resist the carrying out of the division.
Pronouns, again, are differently inflected from nouns,
and they differ among themselves. In other languages,
the system of inflection of the substantive is sometimes
identical and sometimes not. It might be alleged
that the formation of degrees of comparison was a
decisive mark of the adjective: but even here we are
met by the fact that some languages, like Sanscrit, can
compare nouns and even persons of the verb;<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
others, like Latin, can compare the substantive (cf.
Plautus’ use of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oculissimus</i>&mdash;Curc. I. ii. 28, etc.)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amicissimus</i> = ‘(my) best friend,’ etc. This usage is
seen in the English word ‘top-<i>most</i>,’ which is the
substantive <i>top</i> with a double superlative ending (see
Mätzner, vol. i., p. 270); the termination <i>most</i> superseded
the O.E. <i>m- est</i>, which answered to the A.S. (<i>e</i>) <i>mest</i>,
derived from a positive (<i>e</i>) <i>ma</i>, which itself had a
superlative signification (cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optumus</i>). Again, the
very meaning of some adjectives renders them incapable
of comparison; as, <i>wooden</i>, <i>golden</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It is, then, clear that the current division of the
parts of speech, in which all these three principles of
classification are more or less embodied, leads to so
many cross divisions that it cannot be consistently
carried out. The parts of speech cannot be sharply
and neatly partitioned off into eight or nine categories.
There are many necessary transitions from one class
into another; these result from the general laws of
change of meaning, and from analogical formations
which are characteristic of language in general. If we
follow out these transitions, we at the same time
detect the reasons which originally suggested the
division of the parts of speech.</p>

<p>To consider, first, the division between substantive
and adjective. The formal division is based in the
Indo-European languages on the capacity of the
adjective of inflections of gender and comparison. In
individual languages still further distinctions have
arisen. Thus, for instance, the adjective in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Teutonic and Slavonic languages admits of a double,
nay we may even say a triple, mode of inflection: cf.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gut</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">guter</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der gute</i>; in which declensions forms occur
absolutely without analogy in the substantives. In
Modern High German, we have to note the existence
of the two declensions (the weak and the strong).
On their uses and that of the third or undeclined form
of the adjective in the predicate, the most elementary
German grammar will give the student all information.
As for the forms of adjectival (and pronominal)
declension which are distinct from the noun declension,
it is necessary to go back to Anglo-Saxon, or, better
still, to Gothic. It is, of course, not necessary to
master these languages thoroughly in order to simply
compare their systems of inflection. Seeing that in
English the adjectives have no flection, the test is no
longer applicable to the language in its present form;
though the test of capacity for comparison applies
here still. But in spite of all differentiations of form,
the adjective may receive, at first ‘occasionally’ then
‘usually,’ the function of a substantive: cf. <i>The rich
and the poor</i>, <i>old and young</i>, <i>my gallants</i>.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> From
this substantival adjective a pure substantive may
be derived by traditional use, especially if its form
becomes in any way isolated as against other forms of
the adjective; as, <i>sir</i> = Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sieur</i>, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seniorem</i> as
against <i>senior</i>. The instinct of language shows that
it apprehends the adjective definitely as a substantive
when it connects it with an attributive adjective; as,
<i>the powdered pert</i> (Cowper, Task); <i>a respected noble</i>,
etc.: or with a genitive; as, <i>the blue of the sky</i>. In
English the possessive pronoun is connected with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
many words, such as <i>like</i>, <i>better</i>, etc.,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> which, if felt as
adjectives, would demand other constructions. Cf. <i>He
was your better, sir</i> (Sheridan Knowles, Hunchback,
III. ii.); <i>To consult his superiors</i> (Cooper, Spy, ch. i.):
<i>He is my senior</i>.</p>

<p>There are many adjectives in all languages which
are completely transformed, such as <i>sir</i> (cf. supra);
<i>priest</i> (a shortened form of what in French appears
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prêtre</i>, older form <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prestre</i> (cf. Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">priester</i>), all
from Greek <i lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">presbuteros</i>, ‘older,’ the comparative of
<i>presbus</i>, ‘old’); <i>fiend</i>, M.E. <i>fend</i>, A.S. <i>féond</i>, ‘an
enemy,’ originally the present participle of the verb
<i>féon</i>, ‘to hate;’ <i>friend</i>, M.E. <i>frend</i>, A.S. <i>freónd</i>,
originally present participle of <i>fréon</i>, ‘to love;’ etc.</p>

<p>The transformation of a substantive into an adjective
is less familiar, and perhaps more interesting. In
the process, we disregard some parts of the meaning
of the substantive, excluding from that meaning first
and foremost the meaning of substance, so that only
the qualities attaching to the substance remain in
view. This transformation virtually occurs as an
occasional use whenever a substantive is employed as
predicate or attribute: <i>a king’s cloak</i> (for <i>a royal cloak</i>);
<i>He is an ass</i>, etc. A substantive in apposition approaches
the nature of an adjective, especially when it
is used to denote a class; and, again, more especially
when the combination is abnormal and metaphorical:
cf. <i>a virgin fortress</i>; <i>a maiden over</i>; <i>boy-competitors</i>;
<i>turkey-cock</i>, <i>hen-sparrow</i>; <i>a house-maid</i>;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> <i>music-vows</i>
(Hamlet, III. i.) Sometimes an adverb which can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
strictly speaking be connected with an adjective only,
is joined to the substantive, and serves to mark its
adjectival nature. Thus we often hear such expressions
as <i>He is ass enough, idiot enough</i>; <i>More fool
you</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In other cases, again, such as <i>twenty thousand
troops were taken prisoner</i>, the word <i>prisoner</i> shows
by its absence of inflection that it is apprehended as an
adjective.</p>

<p>It might be thought practicable to draw another
distinction that would hold good as between substantive
and adjective. The adjective, it might be alleged,
denotes a simple quality, the substantive connotes a
group of qualities. In such a word as <i>blue</i>, we have
the one broad idea of one colour fairly defined and
commonly understood within certain definite limits.
In the meaning of, e.g., <i>rose</i>, we embrace all the qualities
which go to make up our conception of <i>flower</i> in
general, and the <i>special flower</i> which we call <i>rose</i> in
particular. And no doubt the definition may be considered
in the main correct. But the distinction
cannot be consistently maintained throughout. For
instance, there are many adjectives which cannot be
said to indicate really one quality only. Such are
most adjectives in <i>like</i> or <i>ly</i> (<i>warlike</i>, <i>manly</i>, etc.); and,
on the other hand, substantives are again and again
used so as to denote one quality and only one. The
transition from the denotation of a simple quality to
that of a group of qualities is effected by the use <i>in a
special sense</i> of a substantival adjective; as, ‘the blacks,’
for ‘the negroes’ = ‘a radical,’ ‘a conservative.’ When
once such usage has been started, there is no necessity
for the train of thought, which led the first
employer to specialise the word, to be present in the
consciousness of other speakers. Directly the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
has come to be so specialised, and the train of thought
which led to its specialisation has been forgotten, the
word stands isolated as an independent substantive.</p>

<p>The converse process is not uncommon; in which,
out of a group of qualities, a single one is dwelt on and
the rest are left out of consideration: such are, for
instance, the names of colours; as, <i>lilac</i>, <i>rose</i>, <i>mulberry</i>,
etc., used adjectivally. From this use the adjectives
with specialised meanings, derived from substantives,
we may gather that <i>adjectives</i>, i.e. <i>terms for simple
qualities, arose out of terms for groups of qualities</i>, i.e.
<i>substantives</i>. The process must have been from the
very beginning that the speaker singled out one notion
from a group and dwelt on it, passing over the others
bound up in the group. In fact, the speaker must, at
a very early stage, have used words in a figurative
sense. In such expressions as <i>That man is a bear</i>,
<i>That woman is a vixen</i> (as, indeed, when we say <i>bearish</i>
or <i>vixenish</i>), we are ascribing to him or her only some
one particular characteristic of the whole number of
characteristics of the thing which the substantive indicates
when used in its usual sense. The distinction
between noun and verb might seem, at first sight, to
be well marked both by the diversity of forms which
characterise these separate parts of speech, and by the
diversity of functions which they severally fulfil. But
in English, we are at once met by the fact that we
have numerous verbs which are identical in form with
nouns, and in many cases are actually nouns employed
as verbs; as, <i>to lord it</i>, <i>to walk</i>, <i>to dog</i>, <i>to run</i>: while we
constantly see the process going on before our eyes,
of the transference of a noun into the category of
verbs; as, <i>to chair a man</i>, <i>to table a motion</i>. How near
they may approach in function may be seen from
sentences like <i>I looked at the show</i>, and <i>I had a look at</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
<i>the show</i>. No doubt it maybe said that verbs have
certain formal characteristics, which distinguish the
verb from the noun, such as personal terminations,
distinctions between voices, and forms to denote mood
and tense. But, in the first place, these forms have, to
a great extent, disappeared in English, with its other
inflections; and, in the second place, even in the most
highly inflected languages we find verbs defective in
some of these characteristics, and thereby approaching
in form to nouns: cf. the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bisogna andare</i> (= ‘I
need to go’) as against <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che bisogna andare</i> (‘What need
to go?’). While, again in nouns, forms occur defective
in case and gender-signs; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornu</i>, ‘horn;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genu</i>, ‘knee;’
etc. Further, in the Slavonic languages, we actually
find the verb in the past tense agreeing in gender with
its subject; as, <i>Tui jelala</i>, ‘Thou (feminine) didst wish,’
etc. Lastly, the differentiation of the construction of
the two parts of speech is anything but sharply marked,
as we may see in cases where a substantive actually
takes the case which would naturally be taken by the
verb with which it is connected: <i>Seeing her is to love
her</i>; <i>Hearing him recite that poem is enough to draw
tears from the eyes</i>.</p>

<p>Even in highly inflected languages, like Latin and
Greek, the personal endings, commonly regarded as
the special formal characteristic of the verb, have no
place in the participles and infinitives.</p>

<p>Again, such an expression as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rex es</i>, ‘Thou art
king,’ is identical in meaning with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regnas</i>, ‘Thou
rulest;’ so that the verbal termination, as such, need
not serve to mark any distinction of meaning between
the verb and the adjective or substantive used predicatively.</p>

<p>If we say that it is of the essence of the verb to
describe a mere transient process limited by time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
while the adjective or substantive denotes a permanent
quality, we must observe that the adjective may
describe a transient quality; as, <i>dirty</i>, <i>pale</i>: while verbs
may be used to describe states; as, <i>to glow</i>, cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">candere</i>
= to be white.</p>

<p>The participle must be regarded as partaking of
the nature of the verb as well as of that of the
adjective. The peculiarity of the participle, as compared
with the adjective, is that it enables us to express
an occurrence or event attributively; as, <i>They,
looking, saw</i>. We must look upon adjectives as the
older formation of the two, and indeed we must suppose
that adjectives had been completely developed
before participles could take their rise at all.</p>

<p>The characteristic difference between the participle
and the so-called verbal adjective is that the participle,
unlike the adjective, is capable of denoting tense;
as, τύψας (= ‘having struck’). The participle, when
standing as an attribute to a noun, partakes of the
construction of a noun (<i>i.e.</i> substantive or adjective);
as, <i>Vir captus est</i> (‘The man is caught’). But it may
depart from the character of a noun by departing from
such nominal construction, and striking out a new path
of its own.</p>

<p>Thus, in <i>He has taken her</i>, <i>He has slept</i>, we have
a use of the participle quite unlike the use of the
adjective. No doubt it is true that such a phrase as
<i>He has taken her</i> signified originally <i>He has or holds
her as one taken</i>; cf. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cura intentos habebat Romanos</i>,
(Liv., xxvi. 1), but we do not now apprehend the
construction thus. In French, the transition from the
general adjectival into the special participial construction
is clearer: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai vu les dames</i>, ‘I have seen the
ladies;’ but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je les ai vues</i>, ‘I have seen (fem. plur.)
them,’ and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les dames que j’ai vues</i>, ‘the ladies that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
have seen (fem. plur).’ In Italian, we say <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ho vedute</i>
(fem. plur.) <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">le donne</i> = ‘I have seen the ladies,’ as
well as <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ho veduto le donne</i> (masc. or genderless sing.).
In Spanish, all inflection in the case of periphrases
formed with ‘haber’ is abolished; it is as correct to
write <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">la carta que he escrito</i> = ‘the letter which I
have written,’ as to say <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">He escrito una carta</i> = ‘I
have written a letter.’ On the other hand, in periphrases
made with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tener</i> (<i>to hold</i>, used as auxiliary
like to have), a later introduction into the language, the
inflection is always retained; in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tengo escrita una carta</i>,
= ‘I have written (fem.) a letter (fem.)’ it is as imperative
to observe the concord of gender as in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las
cartas que tengo escritas</i> = ‘The letters which I have
written.’</p>

<p>Conversely: it is possible for the participle to
gradually recur to a purely nominal character. Bearing
in mind our definition of the participle, we may
say that this recurrence has taken place as soon as the
present participle is used for the <i>lasting</i> activity; as
when we talk about <i>a knowing man</i>: and as soon as
the perfect participle comes to be used to express the
result of the activity; as, <i>a lost chance</i>. The more
such participle is employed in a specialised meaning&mdash;as,
for instance, metaphorically,&mdash;the more speedily
and thoroughly will the transformation become accomplished;
as in such cases as <i>striking</i>, <i>charming</i>,
<i>elevated</i>, <i>drunken</i>, <i>agèd</i>, <i>learnèd</i>, <i>crabbèd</i>, <i>doggèd</i>, etc.
Nay, such words may even combine with another,
after the laws of verbal construction: as in the case of
<i>high-flying</i>, <i>well-wishing</i>, <i>flesh-eating</i>, <i>new-born</i>, <i>well-educated</i>.</p>

<p>The participle, again, like other adjectives, may
become a substantive, e.g. <i>the anointed</i>; and the substantival
participle, like the adjectival, may either
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
denote a momentary activity (or, rather, an activity
limited as to time), <i>e.g.</i> the <i>patient</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>suffering
one</i>, or a state, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>regent</i> = the <i>ruling one</i> = the
<i>ruler</i>. It may, indeed, entirely lose its verbal nature,
as, <i>friend</i>, <i>fiend</i>, i.e. the <i>loving one</i>, the <i>hating one</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The nomen agentis, resembling in this respect the
participle, may denote either a momentary or a lasting
activity; as, <i>the doer</i> = ‘he who <i>does</i>;’ <i>the dancer</i> (if
= ‘he who is wont to dance,’ <i>e.g.</i>, as his profession).
In the former application it remains closely connected
with the verb; and there is no reason, except custom,
why it should not, like the participle, take an object,
just like the verb; in fact, that it should not be correct
to say <i>the teacher the boy</i> for ‘he who teaches the
boy,’ just as it is possible to say <i>the school-teacher</i>.
We actually do find in Latin, <i>dator divitias</i>, ‘giver
riches (acc. plur.)’ = ‘he who gives riches;’ <i>justa
orator</i> (Plautus, Amphyt., 34), ‘the just things (acc.
neut. plur.) orator or speaker’ = ‘he who speaks just
things.’</p>

<p>In Shakespeare, we find <i>and all is semblative a
woman’s part</i> (Twelfth Night, I. iv.), where an adjective,
<i>semblative</i>, is similarly construed with a verbal force;
the sentence being equivalent to ‘and all resembles
that which we might expect in a woman.’ On the
other hand, the nomen agentis, when denoting lasting
activity, may separate more and more from the verb,
and thus finally lose its special character, as noun indicating
a ‘doer,’ e.g., <i>owner</i>, <i>actor</i>, <i>father</i> (lit. ‘he who
feeds or who protects;’ from a root which means either
<i>to nourish</i> or <i>to protect</i>).</p>

<p>The transition from verb to noun is again seen in
nomina actionis, like <i>transportation</i>, <i>liberation</i>. These
may also approximate to the verbal construction; as,
<i>My transportation from England to Ireland</i> (‘I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
transported from England to Ireland’); <i>pearl fishery</i>
(‘the fishing for pearls’). Here, again, the notion of a
lasting activity inherent in the substantive tends to
make the original idea of a nomen actionis grow faint;
and the connotation of a lasting condition sets in.
And, again, the more that metaphorical and other
unusual or special usages attach to the word, the more
does such word become isolated as against its original
use, cf. <i>position</i>, <i>transportation</i>, <i>conviction</i>, <i>goings-on</i>.
It may, indeed, become so far isolated as to lose all
connection with the verb, as in <i>reckoning</i>, in the sense
of an account; cf. <i>addition</i>, in French, in the same
meaning (cf. the French expression for ‘Waiter! the
bill, please,’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garçon! l’addition s’il vous plaît!</i>)</p>

<p>The infinitive is really a case of the noun of action,
and must originally have been constructed in accordance
with the usage in force at the time for the
syntactical combination of the corresponding verb with
other nouns. But, in order that it may be felt as a
true infinitive, its mode of construction must no longer
be felt as it originally must have been felt; it must, in
fact, have become isolated in its employment, and such
isolation became then the basis of further development.
But the infinitive having thus developed, reverts in
many cases to the character of a noun: its want of
inflection, however, always has a tendency to prevent
this; and, accordingly, the most common cases in
which it appears as a substantive are as subject or
object. In sentences like ‘not to have been dipped in
Lethe’s Lake Could save the son of Thetis from <i>to die</i>’
(Spenser, Faëry Queen); ‘Have is have’ (Shakespeare,
King John, I. i.); ‘I list not prophecy’ (Winter’s Tale,
IV. i. 26); ‘I learn to ride,’ etc., it seems certain that
the infinitive is constructed after the analogy of a
noun; but in such constructions as <i>I let him speak</i>, <i>I</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
<i>hear him walk</i>, it is hardly apprehended as so constructed
by the instinct of language of the present
day.</p>

<p>Languages which possess declined articles possess
exceptional facilities for thus approximating the infinitive
to a noun, as the Greek τὸ φιλεῖν, τοῦ φιλεῖν, etc.
(= ‘the “to love”&mdash;of the <i>to-love</i>,’ etc.): cf. such instances
as the English <i>Have is have</i> (Shakespeare, King
John, I. i.); <i>Mother, what does ‘marry’ mean?</i> (Longfellow);
<i>Him booteth not resist</i> (Spenser, Faëry Queen,
I. iii. 20.) And similarly the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das lieben</i>
(‘the “to-love”’); French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon pouvoir</i> (‘my “to-be-able”’).
In Latin, the same approximation is rendered
possible by the demonstrative pronouns; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">totum hoc
philosophari</i> (Cicero), ‘all this “to-philosophise;”’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inhibere
illud tuum</i> (ibid.), (‘that “to-prohibit” of yours’).
Modern High German and the Romance languages
have gone so far as to employ the infinitive as the
equivalent to a noun pure and simple, even in respect
of inflection; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meines sterbens</i> (= ‘of my “to-die”’);
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein hier-bleiben</i> (= ‘my “here-remain,”’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘my
remaining here’). In the Romance languages, the
process is rendered easier by the abolition of case-difference;
cf. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon savoir-faire</i> (= ‘my “to know&mdash;to-do”’
= ‘my cleverness of management’). Old French
and Provençal actually invest the infinitive with the <i>s</i>
of the nominative case&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Li plorers ne t’i vaut rien</i>:
‘The “to-weep” not to thee there avails anything’
= ‘It avails thee nothing to weep’ (cf. Mätzner, iii.,
pp. 1-2).</p>

<p>It is possible for the verbal construction to be
maintained in many cases, even in spite of the use of
the article. For instance, τὸ σκοπεῖν τῖ πράγματα (lit.
= ‘the “to-see” the matters.’).</p>

<p>The oldest adverbs seem to be mainly in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
origin crystallised cases of nouns (adjectival or substantival),
in some cases of which they are the result
of the combination of a preposition with its case.
Thus, in English, we have the genitive suffix appearing
in <i>else</i> (formerly <i>elles</i>, the genitive of a root <i>el</i> or <i>al</i>,
meaning ‘other’), <i>once</i> (= ‘ones’), <i>twice needs</i>. <i>Much</i>
and <i>little</i> were datives, <i>miclum</i> and <i>lytlum</i>; cf. <i>whilom</i>
(= hwílum.)</p>

<p>Thus, in Latin, many adverbs are derived from the
accusative&mdash;as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum</i>, ‘first;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multum</i>, ‘much;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foras</i>,
‘abroad;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i>, ‘at another time;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facile</i>, ‘easily;’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recens</i>, ‘freshly:’ from the locative&mdash;as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">partim</i>, ‘partly;’
or the ablative, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">falso</i>, ‘falsely;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recta</i>, ‘by the right
way;’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponte</i>, ‘voluntarily.’ The following are instances
of the combination of a preposition with its
regime: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amid</i> (= <i>on-middum</i>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">withal</i>, <i>together</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anon</i>;
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amont</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aval</i> (= prep. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a</i> (‘at’) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mont</i>, ‘mountain,’
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">val</i>, ‘dale’ = <i>upwards</i>, and <i>downwards</i>).</p>

<p>This formation of adverbs leads us to suspect that
the original method of forming them will also probably
have been from nouns; and that as some of
them may have proceeded from nouns before the
development of inflections, in such cases merely the
stem form, pure and simple, was employed to express
adverbs. Thus such expressions as <i>to speak true</i>, <i>to
entreat evil</i>, will represent the oldest types of adverbs.</p>

<p>The adverb stands in close relationship to the
adjective. It bears a relation to the verb and to
the adjective as well, analogous to that borne by an
attributive adjective to a substantive; thus <i>He stepped
lightly</i> is analogous to <i>His steps were light</i>; and <i>That
is absolutely true</i> to <i>The truth of that is absolute</i>. This
analogy manifests itself, among other instances, in
this&mdash;that an adverb may, generally speaking, be
formed from any adjective at will.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

<p>The adjective differs formally from the adverb in
this, that the adjective, commonly speaking, admits of
inflection, and hence of agreement with the substantive.
In English, where this test is absent, it is difficult for
the instinct of language to draw a sharp line between
the two, as in <i>to speak loud</i>, <i>to speak low</i>. It is difficult,
in English, to maintain that there is any real difference
between the use of <i>good</i> in <i>good-natured</i> and the same
word in <i>he is good</i>; or the use of <i>well</i> in <i>he is well
dressed</i>, and in <i>he is well</i>.</p>

<p>Again, many adverbs in different languages resemble
adjectives in this, that, when joined to another adverb,
they take an adjectival inflection. Thus, in French,
it is correct to say ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toute</i> pure,’ ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toutes</i> pures’ = ‘entire,
(fem. sing.) pure,’ ‘entire (fem. plur.) pure (fem. plur.);’
both = ‘entirely pure,’ ‘quite pure:’ in Italian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tutta
livida</i> = ‘all (fem. sing.) livid’ = ‘quite livid:’ in
Spanish, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">todos desnudos</i> = ‘all (masc. plur.) nude’ =
‘quite naked.’</p>

<p>There are many cases in which an attributive
adjective is employed convertibly with an adverb; cf.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hispania postrema perdomita est</i> = ‘Spain <small>LAST</small> (fem.
sing.) was conquered,’ for ‘<small>AT LAST</small>’ (Livy, xxviii. 12);
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il arrive toujours le dernier</i>, ‘He always comes last;’
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est mort content</i> = ‘He died happy.’ Compare also
these two usages&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De ces deux sœurs la cadette est celle
qui est le plus aimée</i>, ‘Of these two sisters the younger
is the one who is the (neut.) more loved (fem. sing.);’
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la plus aimée</i>, ‘the (fem.) more loved (fem.)’
(Acad.)<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Adjectives used in connection with nouns signifying
the agent or the action are used in a way hardly
to be distinguished from an adverbial use; as, <i>a good
story</i>, <i>a good story-teller</i>, <i>an old bookseller</i>. In English,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
owing to its lack of inflections, an ambiguity may arise
in such cases as the last cited; we might apply the
word <i>old</i> to the man who sells the books, as well as to
the books themselves. The common custom in English
is to shun ambiguity by the use of the hyphen; as,
<i>an old-book seller</i>. But English attempts likewise to
remove the ambiguity by maintaining the adverb for
one case, after the analogy of the construction with the
verb&mdash;as, <i>an early riser</i>, <i>a timely arrival</i>, etc.&mdash;though
this distinction is not consistently carried out.</p>

<p>The resemblance of adjectives and adverbs produces
uncertainty in the meaning to be attached to
certain adjectives; the adjective, when attached to a
noun, may be conceived of as referring either to the
person, or as referring to one of his qualities; thus, <i>a
bad coachman</i> may either mean ‘a wicked coachman,’
or ‘a coachman looked upon as bad in the quality of
his driving.’ In the latter case, the adjective is used
in the special sense acquired by the adverb; as, <i>he
drives badly</i>.</p>

<p>It is natural, then, as the adjective and the adverb
so generally exist in pairs, that we should feel the
need of possessing both parts of speech for all cases.
There are, however, many adverbs which are derived
from no adjective, and which thus have no adjective
parallel to them. In this case we are compelled to
employ the adverb with the function of the adjective,
as in ‘He is <i>there</i>,’ ‘He is <i>up</i>,’ ‘The door is <i>to</i>,’ ‘Heaven
is <i>above</i>;’ in which cases the instinct of language apprehends
the construction as identical with that found in
such phrases as <i>He is active</i>, <i>The door is open</i>, etc.
Again, in such sentences as <i>the mountain yonder</i>, <i>the
enemy there</i>, <i>the drive hither</i>, the adverb marks its
difference from the adjective by its position in the
sentence. But this rule is not consistently observed;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
there are cases in English where the adverb is inserted
between the article and its substantive; as, <i>on the
hither-side</i>, <i>the above discourse</i>, <i>the then monarch</i>, and
more extensively in the vulgar <i>that there mountain</i>,
<i>this here book</i>, where the adjectival adverbs are
pleonastic.</p>

<p>Just as, <i>e.g.</i>, in Latin, we find the adverb used in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic sum</i> (‘so I am’), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego hunc esse aliter credidi</i>,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
‘I him to be otherwise believed’ = ‘I thought he was
a different kind of man;’ so we find in English <i>While
this scene was passing in the cabin of the man, one quite
otherwise</i> (i.e. <i>different</i>) <i>was passing in the halls of the
master</i> (Mrs. Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, i.
43), in which, and other similar constructions, the
adverb again has all the functions of an adjective.</p>

<p>Prepositions and conjunctions as link-words or connecting
elements took their origin from independent
words through a displacement of the distribution.
Prepositions were once adverbs, serving to denote
more closely the direction of the verbal action; as, ‘to
go <i>in</i>,’ ‘to carry <i>off</i>,’ ‘to throw <i>up</i>,’ ‘to fall <i>down</i>.’
They then became displaced, <i>i.e.</i> detached from the
verb, and came to belong to the noun, furthering the
disappearance of its case-endings and assuming their
office.</p>

<p>To stamp a word as ‘connecting word,’ this displacement
must have become customary and general.
For, in their occasional usage, the most various parts
of speech may serve as connecting words. The
functions of the adverb, as such, have been sufficiently
illustrated. It is thus only where such adverbs are
with a certain regularity, or preferably, used as link-words,
that they begin to be felt as prepositions or
conjunctions. But even then, notwithstanding such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
syntactical development, the word can still be used
independently in its former function, and it remains
impossible to definitely range it in any particular class.
This only becomes rational and feasible when the
word has become obsolete in its original usage.</p>

<p>We may accordingly define a preposition as a link-word
which may be followed by any substantive in
some of its case-forms where this combination is no
longer syntactically parallel to that between noun
or verb and the word in its original independent
sense. Accepting this definition, we shall not explain
<i>considering</i>, in such a sentence as <i>considering
everything he has done very well</i>, as a preposition,
because its construction is that of the verb <i>to consider</i>.
When we come to <i>instead of</i> it is different. <i>Stead</i>,
A.S. <i>stede</i>, meant ‘a place;’ and <i>in the stead of the man</i>
would have been a perfectly natural construction, the
genitive case showing the independence of the noun:
but whether the genitive is still felt as a genitive
depends on the question whether we think of <i>instead</i>
as a compound of the preposition <i>in</i> with the noun
<i>stead</i>. As soon as we cease to feel it as such, we do
not think of the genitive as regularly depending on
the preceding substantive, and the preposition is
created. No doubt the instance which we have given
proves that the instinct of language is vacillating; we
still find <i>in his stead</i> looked upon as somewhat archaic
indeed, but still current English. In some cases the
isolation has become looser, and in others it has
become absolute. The word <i>nigh</i> (A.S. <i>neáh</i>, M.E.
<i>neigh</i>, as in ‘neighbour’) was originally an adverb, and
identical in meaning with the word <i>near</i> (A.S. <i>néar</i>,
the comparative degree of <i>néah</i>). But we do not
think of <i>nigh</i> and <i>near</i> as connected. The word <i>till</i>
is still more peculiar. It is, properly speaking, a case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
of A.S. <i>tíli</i>, a noun (cf. Germ. <i>Ziel</i>, Gothic <i>tils</i>)
meaning ‘aim’ or ‘goal,’ whence the idea of <i>towards</i>
developed. <i>Off</i> and <i>of</i> are not thought of as connected,
and yet they are the same word. In this case
the relationship becomes obscured, owing to divergency
in the development of signification. In other cases
the isolation of the word is due to the disappearance
of the old method of construction in which it was
used. Thus <i>since</i>, M.E. <i>sithens</i>, is from <i>síððen</i> = A.S.
<i>síððan</i>, which is itself a construction for <i>síððan</i>, put for
<i>síððam</i>, ‘after that.’ Here the <i>ðam</i> is the dative case
masculine of the demonstrative pronoun used as a
relative; it answers exactly to the N.H.G. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">seit dem</i>; cf.
<i>ni ðanaseiðs</i> (Ulphilas, Mark ii. 14) + ‘no more.’ In the
same way, the word <i>ere</i> is a comparative form derived
from A.S. <i>ǽr</i>, ‘soon.’</p>

<p>The origin and rise of the conjunctions may, like
that of the prepositions, be followed historically. Many
of them arise from adverbs or pronouns in their
function as connective words, as we have discussed
in the foregoing paragraphs. These words, then, are
already connecting-words ere they become established
as conjunctions pure and simple. All depends thus
upon the linguistic consciousness of the speaker,
whether he will consider them as still pronoun or
adverb, or as real conjunction, and this consciousness,
again, is largely dependent upon the degree to which
the word in question has been etymologically obscured.</p>

<p>We have seen how the demonstrative <i>that</i> has
become a conjunction, and can easily realise how to
some extent in many others, such as <i>because</i>, <i>in case</i>,
etc., though no demonstrative word proper has entered
into their composition, the relation of the noun which
forms their second part to what follows is of a demonstrative
kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span></p>

<p>Prepositions and conjunctions are more clearly
distinguishable in such languages, as, <i>e.g.</i>, German,
where the flection of noun and adjective, or the
absence of flection, shows whether the word is used
as the one or the other. In English, this test has
disappeared. But even in highly inflected tongues
this test is not applicable in cases where a preposition
is used before an indeclinable word or combination
of words. And that such difference could not arise
before the flection had arisen, is self-evident.

<span class="medium">LANGUAGE AND WRITING.</span></h2>

<p>We have now to consider the question of the relation
of writing to language; how far it has influenced it,
and continues to influence it; and for what reasons
it seems an inadequate representation of language.
The first thing necessary for us to remember is that,
though writing is the only means whereby the speech
of the past has been preserved for us, yet it is equally
true that, before we can consider writing at all, we
have to convert it into spoken language, and to
affix sounds to the symbols of language which have
descended to us from the past. All such translation
of symbols affixed to language in the past must
necessarily be imperfect; we can only arrive approximately,
for instance, at a satisfactory conjecture of the
actual sounds of the English language as spoken by
Shakespeare; and the data for determining such
questions must always be more or less incomplete.</p>

<p>The written representation of language must,
however, always be an interesting object of study to
the philologist&mdash;partly because it has been the vehicle
of the sounds of language, and partly because it is
an important factor in the development of language
itself.</p>

<p>Writing appeals, in the first place, to a much larger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
community than speaking. A single page of written
matter may appeal to thousands more easily than the
most eloquent sermon or address. Nay, writing may
in this way appeal to the whole of a linguistic community,
causing those of the present time to exert
their influence on generations yet unborn.</p>

<p>Writing which consistently and regularly represents
the spoken language must be more effective in perpetuating
that language than writing which does not
so represent it. Theoretically, we assume that written
languages fall into one or other of these classes, and
we classify them as languages spelt phonetically and
spelt non-phonetically, or, as some prefer to express it,
historically.</p>

<p>But we must remember that no alphabet, however
perfect, can assume to be a correct picture of language.
Language consists of a continuous series of sounds,
never broken, but consecutive. Just as no amount of
drops of water separately considered could give the
picture of a river, so no amount of symbols, however
minute, could give the real picture of a sentence. A
sentence, nay, a single word, is a continuous whole;
the symbols whereby we represent it can represent
only the chief parts, and represent them as disconnected.
The transitions, the links remain unindicated,
and so do such important factors as quantity, accent,
and tone.</p>

<p>Further, the alphabets in use are, even the best of
them, imperfect. It is plain that, when the members
of a particular linguistic community, like, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Germans or the Portuguese, seek to make their
alphabet a consistent picture of the sounds of speech,
they aim merely at representing the sounds of their
own language. A scientific alphabet should aim at
representing all possible sounds, and not merely those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
needed in an alphabet of a particular linguistic
community.</p>

<p>Even in the case of the best-spelt languages, <i>i.e.</i>
the languages in which the principle of one sound
standing for one sign, and one sign for one single
sound obtains, we shall find that these aim only at
satisfying the ordinary practical needs of the language.
They make as few distinctions as is consistent with
ordinary clearness and consistency. For instance,
they deem it unnecessary to denote the difference of
sounds arising from the position of a letter in a
syllable, a word, or an accent, provided only that a
similarity of position produces habitually similar results.
A certain degree of consistency is thus attained without
a superfluity of symbols. In Modern High German,
for instance, the <i>hard s</i> sound in <i>lust</i>, <i>brust</i>, etc., has
the same symbol to represent it as that which elsewhere
represents the <i>soft s</i> sound: but no ambiguity
arises from this, because <i>s</i>, when followed by <i>t</i>, unless
the group <i>st</i> is initial, is always hard; thus the <i>s</i> in
<i>reist</i> is pronounced as in <i>lust</i>. Similarly, final <i>s</i> is
habitually pronounced hard or unvoiced; as, <i>hass</i>, <i>glas</i>,
<i>eis</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way, in English, it would have been
superfluous, in an alphabet merely directed to satisfy
practical needs, to adopt a special sign for the front
nasal <i>n</i> in <i>sing</i>; because <i>n</i>, followed by and combined
with <i>g</i>, always has the same sound. Similarly, <i>n</i>, in
such combinations as the Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vigne</i>, Ital. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ogni</i>, has a
consistent and regular pronunciation, and therefore
there is no need for any special representation of it.</p>

<p>There are indeed languages, like Sanscrit, in
which the principle of phonetic spelling is more or
less carefully carried out. Generally, however, we
find that the same sign of any particular alphabet has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
to serve for more than one sound, and it almost
invariably happens that we augment the confusion by
employing different signs for one and the same sound.
The chief reason for these defects is because most
nations, instead of creating symbols to represent the
sounds in their own language, have been content to
adopt an alphabet ready to hand, made to suit the
requirements of the language of another nation. Thus
the alphabet used by most civilised nations was that
which the Phenicians elaborated from the Egyptian
hieroglyphics; and the Russians adopted with modifications
the Greek adaptation of this. Another reason
for the inconsistency is that, as pronunciation changes,
it is obvious that the denotation of symbols ought to
change as well. These same causes may also produce
an unnecessary superfluity of symbols. In English,
for instance, the alphabet suffers alike from superfluity
and defect. Several signs serve to denote the same
sound, as <i>c</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>ch</i>; <i>c</i>, <i>s</i>; <i>oo</i>, <i>ou</i>; <i>ou</i>, <i>ow</i>; <i>a</i>, <i>ai</i>; <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>ee</i>,
<i>ea</i>, <i>ie</i>, <i>ei</i>; <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>; <i>cks</i>, <i>x</i>; <i>oa</i>, <i>aw</i>; and many others
might be cited. Again, there are many cases in which
the same symbols denote different sounds, such as <i>th</i>
in <i>thin</i> and <i>then</i>; <i>a</i> in <i>hat</i> and <i>fatal</i>; <i>i</i> in <i>pin</i> and <i>pine</i>.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>It is not the place here to point out in detail the
advantages of a well-spelt language over a less well-spelt
one.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Practically, however, the consideration
cannot be disregarded that, if English orthography
represented English pronunciation as closely as Italian
does Italian, at least half the time and expense of
teaching to read and to spell would be saved. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
is assumed by Dr. Gladstone<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> to be twelve hundred
hours in a lifetime, and as more than half a million of
money per annum for England and Wales alone. A
few instances, taken mainly from Pitman’s work, may
serve to show how all-pervading the irregularity is.</p>

<p>The same symbol serves to denote different vowel
sounds (1) even in words etymologically connected; as,
<i>sane</i>, <i>sanity</i>; <i>nation</i>, <i>national</i>; <i>navy</i>, <i>navigate</i>; <i>metre</i>,
<i>metrical</i>; <i>final</i>, <i>finish</i>; <i>floral</i>, <i>florid</i>; <i>student</i>, <i>study</i>;
<i>punitive</i>, <i>punish</i>: (2) in words etymologically unconnected,
as in <i>fare</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>save</i>; <i>were</i>, <i>mere</i>; <i>give</i>, <i>dive</i>;
<i>notice</i>, <i>entice</i>; <i>active</i>, <i>arrive</i>; <i>doctrine</i>, <i>divine</i>; <i>gone</i>, <i>bone</i>;
<i>dove</i>, <i>move</i>, <i>rove</i>, <i>hover</i>. Again, cf., <i>change</i>, <i>flange</i>;
<i>paste</i>, <i>caste</i>; <i>bind</i>, <i>wind</i>; <i>most</i>, <i>cost</i>; <i>rather</i>, <i>bather</i>;
<i>there</i>, <i>here</i>; <i>fasting</i>, <i>wasting</i>.</p>

<p>By collecting examples in this way, Mr. Pitman
has arrived at the conclusion that, in English, we endeavour
to express fourteen distinct sounds by using
five signs in twenty-three different ways, without any
real means of discriminating when one sound and when
another is intended, or what sign should be used to
denote a particular sound. But besides these separate
vowel signs, digraphs and trigraphs to the number of
twenty-two are used to express the same fourteen
sounds which the five vowel signs have already attempted
to represent; though they, in addition, attempt
to represent two more diphthongal sounds, making
sixteen distinct sounds in all. For instance, <i>pail</i>, <i>said</i>,
<i>plaid</i>; <i>pay</i>, <i>says</i>; <i>heat</i>, <i>sweat</i>, <i>great</i>, <i>heart</i>; <i>receive</i>,
<i>vein</i>, <i>height</i>; <i>key</i>, <i>prey</i>, <i>eye</i>; <i>sour</i>, <i>pour</i>, <i>would</i>; <i>town</i>,
<i>sown</i>.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>Of the consonants, we may remark, in the first
place, that many are silent, as in <i>debt</i>, <i>limb</i>, <i>indict</i>,
<i>condemn</i>: in some cases, silent consonants have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
interpolated to suggest a mistaken derivation, as in
<i>sovereign</i>, <i>foreign</i>, <i>island</i>; in others, again, they have
been capriciously retained to mark the derivation of a
word (as in <i>receipt</i>), and yet omitted in the case of
other words derived from the same source. Then,
for instances of the inconsistent use of consonants, we
may take the following table from Pitman; (a few
examples have been <span class="nowrap">added):&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow">
<i>ch.</i>&mdash;<i>church</i>, <i>chaise</i>, <i>ache</i>; <i>yacht</i>, <i>drachm</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>ck.</i>&mdash;<i>pick</i> (<i>k</i> or <i>c</i> superfluous).
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>gh.</i>&mdash;<i>ghost</i>, <i>cough</i>, <i>hough</i>; <i>dough</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>inveigh</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>ng.</i>&mdash;<i>singer</i>, <i>linger</i>, <i>infringer</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>ph.</i>&mdash;<i>physic</i>, <i>nephew</i>; <i>phthisical</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>rh.</i>&mdash;<i>rhetoric</i>, <i>myrrh</i>, <i>catarrh</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>sc.</i>&mdash;<i>science</i>, <i>conscience</i>, <i>discern</i>, <i>score</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>sch.</i>&mdash;<i>schism</i>, <i>schedule</i>, <i>scheme</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>th.</i>&mdash;<i>thistle</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>thyme</i>.
</span>
<span class="trow"><i>wh.</i>&mdash;<i>whet</i>, <i>whole</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>If, in addition to these obvious defects in alphabets,
we bear in mind the fact that the accentuation commonly
remains for the most part undenoted, we must
admit that our alphabets present us with a very
imperfect picture of spoken language. For an attempt
to realise a scientifically correct alphabet, we must
refer to Sweet’s ‘Handbook of Phonetics,’ and Melville
Bell’s ‘Visible Speech,’ ‘Sounds and their Relations,’
A. J. Ellis, etc., not to mention the works in
other languages, such as those by Techmer, Vietor,
Trautmann, Sievers, etc.</p>

<p>We have to bear in mind that writing is to living
language nothing more than what a rough sketch is to
a finished picture. The sketch is, commonly speaking,
sufficient to enable one familiar with the figures which
are meant to be represented, to recognise them. But
should several painters attempt to reproduce a finished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
sketch from such rough outline, they would produce
a set of pictures differing very much in details. For
instance, each painter, if he did not recognise certain
objects in the sketch, would be tempted to substitute
in their place others with which he might be familiar.
Just so, those who seek to reproduce the sounds of a
language from written symbols, will be tempted to
substitute similar sounds with which they are familiar
for the sounds of the sketch, as, for our purpose, we
may call the alphabet. Even in the case of a foreign
language possessing an alphabet in some respects
identical with our own, like the French, it is considered
necessary to prefix to the alphabet a description of the
sound intended to be conveyed by the symbol; and
even this cannot obviate the necessity of hearing the
sound, especially when the alphabet is not based upon
scientific principles. It is equally true that the same
remarks are applicable to the case of a dialect belonging
to the same group of languages as our own.</p>

<p>In any linguistic area where the same language is
spoken, there exist different dialects, <i>i.e.</i> variations
from the standard language possessing a quantity of
divergencies from the sounds of the standard language.
The common alphabet has to stand as the representative
of all these dialects alike, and the same symbol
has to present, for instance, the <i>u</i> sound as uttered by
a west countryman and as uttered by a Scotchman.
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">R</i>, again, is pronounced by a Londoner quite differently
from the way in which it is pronounced by a Scotchman.
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">F</i> is pronounced like <i>v</i> in Devonshire and
Cornwall; and the <i>h</i> is in many words notoriously
written but not pronounced in the greater part of
England proper. Besides such obvious differences,
which might be multiplied indefinitely,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> we have to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
remember that the quantity, the pitch, and the accent
remain undenoted by the standard alphabet in the
different dialects; and we shall easily see that a large
quantity of dialectic differences is taken no account of
in writing. The obvious result of this want of adequate
representation of the sounds of the separate dialects
must be that the speakers in the separate dialects
must each consider that the sound with which he is
himself familiar is the one intended to be represented
by the symbol which he sees.</p>

<p>The result of our present system of representing
sounds is that we are unable to give an idea of other
dialects than our own, except in cases where the
discrepancy between these and our own is very
strongly marked. Even in such cases merely a rough
indication of the pronunciation can be given; but the
delicate and manifold differences occurring between
the speech of individuals of different communities
and different generations must pass unmarked. It is
needless to add that the present system of representation
of sounds is useless as a register of the actual
state of pronunciation, and of the changes which are
gradually occurring. How interesting would it be to
Englishmen had a scientific alphabet been employed
to record the different stages of pronunciation of their
language, so that the nineteenth century might know
with approximate exactitude how Chaucer, Shakespeare,
and Milton spoke!</p>

<p>But in any changes which we may see fit to make
in orthography, we must beware of supposing that, in
a perfect alphabet, we should possess an absolutely
controlling influence over pronunciation and sound
changes. No doubt if sounds were accurately registered
by a scientific alphabet, the more educated classes of
the community who were familiar with this alphabet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
and its denotation would be led to attempt to maintain
their pronunciation in accordance with the standard
afforded them by this. But, even assuming that such
an alphabet were generally adopted, it is plain that it
could only represent one particular dialect of any
linguistic area, which dialect would, as a rule, be that
of the best-educated classes in the community. Then,
as now, dialects would remain unrepresented, or, at
the best, would be registered for scientific purposes
or for a limited use. Then, as now, absolutely different
sounds occurring in different dialects would be denoted
by the same letters. Then, as now, different sound
images would be associated with different letters, which
are, of course, merely connected with sounds by an
association of ideas. Then, as now, the written
language would be unable to record the changes that
had passed upon the language of an entire community,
confining itself to those that had passed over the
normal or standard dialect, which, as we have seen,
would be in England the dialect of the educated
classes. But it must be held that language is not
consciously altered to suit orthography; any such
alteration would be contrary to the common development
of language. The orthography may, however,
be altered to suit the language; but, as it is obvious
that the language must change more quickly than the
orthography, it follows that the orthography must
remain, at the best, an imperfect record of written
sounds.</p>

<p>The defects of written speech which have been
already indicated are not as great as those which set
in when the orthography of a language has been long
settled. The original spellers tried to commit the
sounds of each word to writing; they broke up the
word into its elements, and compounded the letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
corresponding to these elements to the best of their
ability. But there is no doubt that practice in reading
and writing makes this process continually shorter.
The consciousness that the symbol is bound up with
the sound grows gradually fainter. A group of
symbols represents a group of sounds; and the sounds
are apprehended in groups, and not singly. The
sentence, and not the word, becomes the basis of
reading. Indeed, fluent reading and writing would
be impossible if this were not the case. Poets, like
Burns, who write in their own dialect, however much
they may try to reproduce accurately the sounds of
that dialect, and however well they may succeed, still
are fain to content themselves with a certain conventional
approximation to accurate representation;
in fact they are very much influenced by the conventional
orthography of the literary language. They
are also constrained to attempt to produce an
approximate amount of accuracy with the smallest
amount of labour; and their labour is considerably
lessened by their acceptance of conventional symbols.
Our forefathers really tried to indicate consistently
their pronunciation of their words. They tried to
spell phonetically, and the result may be seen in the
different spellings of the manuscripts of Langland,
Chaucer, Shakespeare, etc.</p>

<p>The advantages of a fixed orthography are mainly
that the reader connects a definite orthographic image
with a definite signification. We can understand this
if we take two words which are pronounced identically
but differently spelt, such as <i>bough</i>, and the verb to <i>bow</i>.
Were these words written identically, the written picture
common to the two would associate itself with the
sound common to the two words, whereas, at present,
each meaning has its own distinct symbol. Each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
divergence in spelling, though from a phonetic point
of view it may be an improvement, increases the
difficulty of understanding what is written. Divergencies
or want of fixity in spelling may arise from
the awkwardness of writers, who may have employed
several signs to denote the same sound, or a single
sign for more than one; or, again, it may arise from
the want of some controlling body, like an academy,
whose business it is to regulate orthography. On the
other hand, it may be due to the very perfection and
consistency of the characteristics of the language
which has to be reproduced. If, for instance, as in
Sanscrit, or in Welsh, the spelling of the same word
varies with its pronunciation according to its position
in the sentence, a single meaning must be expressed
by different symbols, and it is impossible for one
definite written picture to connect itself with the first
form. The more fixed the orthography, the more is
the process in reading and writing facilitated.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is true that the natural tendency
of the orthography is towards greater fixity, though
it is also true that retrogressive movements sometimes
occur, as when marked phonetic changes set in.
There are three principal methods whereby it is
commonly sought to produce a fixed and uniform
orthography: (1) by the abolition of variations between
several different methods of spelling; (2) by regarding
etymology and taking it as a guide to orthography;
and (3) by holding to traditional spelling and disregarding
sound. The first of these methods is,
generally speaking, in accordance with the aims of
phonetic reformers; the two latter are in direct
contravention of their aims. But against these efforts
to produce fixity in orthography there remains always
the counter tendency to bring language and its written
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
expression into harmony; and this tendency exhibits
itself partly in the effort to correct original deficiencies
in spelling, and partly in a reaction against the discrepancies
constantly produced in written language
by sound-change. As these two tendencies are constantly
operative, the history of orthography is a
description of the temporary triumph of one or other
of these two forces.</p>

<p>If we should institute a comparison between the
development of writing and that of language, we shall
find certain points of resemblance, and others of
marked divergence. With reference to the latter;
in the first place, changes in orthography are brought
about more consciously, and with more purpose on the
part of the writer, than changes of language on the
part of the speaker. In the second place, whereas in
language a whole linguistic community is exposed to a
change, in the case of writing, only that portion of the
community who write or print or publish are directly
interested. And thus it is that the authority of single
individuals is able to carry weight to a much larger
extent than in language. Again, orthographical
changes do not depend upon personal contact, but
appeal to the eye, and therefore are capable of affecting
a wider, if a less numerous, public than linguistic
changes. A good instance of the effect of changed
orthography is seen in the Welsh language as contrasted
with the Gaelic. The Welsh has changed its
old cumbrous orthography for a simpler and more
phonetic system; and, in consequence, the Welsh
language has become more easy to acquire, and,
generally speaking, a handier instrument of literary
intercourse. No reformer has arisen for Gaelic,
which consequently is little read and little written in
comparison with its Cymric sister.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>One of the most obvious difficulties that meets the
orthographical reformer at the outset is the presence
in the alphabet of one or more signs to represent the
same sound, a case which has been already referred to
in this chapter. This superfluity of sound-signs may
be an inheritance from the language whence the
alphabet in use is borrowed; thus, in our alphabet,
we have received <i>c</i> and <i>k</i> and <i>q</i>, all denoting the same
sound. Or, again, it may happen that, in the language
from which the alphabet was borrowed, two signs had
a different value, but that the language which borrows
them is unable to employ these signs to make such a
distinction, which, indeed, does not exist in it. Thus,
the Greek alphabet employed χ to represent the
aspirated guttural; but, as we do not employ that
sound at all, the symbol <i>ch</i>, as seen in <i>cholera</i>, is
superfluous. Again, both symbols of the borrowed
language easily pass into use in the language which
borrows them, if the sound which the borrowing
language means to represent lies between the two
sounds represented by the symbols borrowed. Thus,
for instance, in the Upper German dialect, at the time
of the introduction of the Latin alphabet, there was no
distinction answering to that between the Latin <i>g</i> and
<i>k</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, <i>f</i> and <i>v</i>, consequently, one of these symbols
was, for that particular German dialect, superfluous.</p>

<p>In English there is one cause of vacillation which
should be noticed as of interest, viz., the attempt of
certain writers to omit certain letters which seem to
them superfluous, as when <i>honor</i>, <i>color</i>, etc. are written
instead of <i>honour</i>, <i>colour</i>, etc. As far as this spelling
expresses supposed philological accuracy, it is, of
course, erroneous.</p>

<p>Superfluities in spelling are disposed of in much
the same way as superfluities in words and forms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
The simplest way is by the disuse of one of the two
signs. The other way is by differentiating the signs
which were originally used indifferently. This differentiation
may serve to supply a want in the language;
as when, in Modern German, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>j</i>, <i>v</i> were
gradually parted into vowel and consonant. Thirdly,
it happens that one manner of spelling becomes usual
in one word, and a different manner in another, the
differences depending upon mere caprice. Thus we
spell <i>precede</i>, but <i>proceed</i>; <i>proceeding</i>, but <i>procedure</i>;
<i>stream</i> (from A.S. <i>stréam</i>) with <i>ea</i>, but <i>steep</i> (A.S.
<i>stéap</i>) with <i>ee</i>. A.S. <i>bréad</i> is now written <i>bread</i>, but
A.S. <i>réad</i> has become <i>red</i>; A.S. <i>nu</i> we write <i>now</i>,
but <i>ðu</i> is at present <i>thou</i>; etc. Some of these and
similar inconsistencies owe at least their preservation,
if not their origin, to the desire of differentiating in
the spelling such words as have the same sound but
different meanings; e.g., <i>to</i> and <i>too</i>, <i>steel</i> and <i>steal</i>, <i>red</i>
and <i>read</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Etymology, or, more correctly, etymological grouping,
and analogy have great influence upon spelling, as
well as on the spoken language. Again and again an
older phonetical spelling has been replaced by a real
or fanciful etymological one. Thus, for instance, it is
owing to the influence of etymological grouping when
certain alternations of sound, due to flection or other
change of position, are left without indication by any
corresponding changes of spelling. Thus, in Anglo-Saxon,
the word <i>dæg</i> had its plural <i>dagas</i>. Final <i>g</i>
was dropped, and the vowel before it changed into
the sound now represented by <i>ay</i> in <i>day</i>. A <i>g</i> between
two vowels, however, generally became <i>w</i>, and, accordingly,
<i>dagas</i> became <i>dawes</i>, a form frequently found in
Middle English. In this case, <i>analogy</i> interfered, and
a new ‘regular’ plural, formed directly from the singular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
<i>day</i>, replaced the older historically correct form. It is,
however, possible to imagine that this had not happened
in the spoken language, and that, whilst people <small>SAID</small>
<i>day</i>, <i>dawes</i>, they had <small>WRITTEN</small> <i>day</i>, <i>dayes</i>. Or rather,
if the declined cases in the singular had remained in
use&mdash;in which cases, also, the <i>g</i> stood between two
vowels&mdash;that the <i>w</i> written in the declined cases of the
singular, and in all cases of the plural, had begun in
time to be <i>written</i> also in the nominative singular,
where the <i>y</i> was the ‘regular’ form. This supposititious
case is only an instance of what has happened in many
languages, <i>e.g.</i>, in German. German ‘unvoices’ all
final consonants; <i>i.e.</i>, a <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>, when final, is pronounced
<i>t</i>, a <i>p</i> or <i>b</i> is pronounced <i>p</i>, etc. Before terminations
of inflection, however, <i>d</i> and <i>b</i> remained ‘voiced,’ and
we find accordingly in Middle High German such
pairs as nom. <i>tac</i>, gen. <i>tages</i>. The <i>g</i> of the declined
cases has, however, supplanted the <i>c</i> of the nominative
singular, and the word is now written throughout with
<i>g</i>, though no one pronounces the same sound in the
nominative singular, as in, say, <i>tages</i>, or nom. plur.
<i>tage</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Again, etymological considerations first caused and
now preserve the insertion of <i>b</i> in <i>debt</i>, <i>g</i> in <i>reign</i>.
That, in many cases, these etymological considerations
arose from sheer ignorance does not alter the fact that
it was their influence which, after causing the insertion
of, <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>g</i> in <i>sovereign</i>, the <i>h</i> in <i>rhythm</i>, the <i>l</i> in
<i>could</i>, the <i>w</i> in <i>whole</i>, the <i>p</i> in <i>receipt</i>, saved these
absurdities from desirable extinction.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that, owing to these
very irregularities and inconsistencies of spelling, as
far as it is to be regarded as representing the spoken
language, we owe sometimes a greater uniformity and
regularity in the grammar of the <i>written</i> language than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
could obtain if spelling followed pronunciation more
closely than it does.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, in most weak verbs the past
tense is expressed in writing by the addition of <i>ed</i>,
though sometimes, in the spoken word, nothing but
the sound of <i>d</i> (<i>I roll</i>, <i>I rolled</i>), or even <i>t</i> (<i>I express</i>, <i>I
expressed</i>), is added. The <i>ed</i>, in these cases, may be
considered to be preserved partly from habit, partly
from a feeling, to some extent etymological, that such
and such a meaning (or change of meaning) is indicated
by such and such a spelling or letter-group.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="medium">ON MIXTURE IN LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>There are two senses in which we may speak of
mixture in language&mdash;the broader sense in which
every speaker must influence those who hear him, and
be influenced by them in turn, and the narrower sense
in which one language or one dialect is influenced by
another with which it is but distantly connected.</p>

<p>In order to understand the process of such mixture
as this, we ought to observe, in the first place, what
passes in the case of individuals. The circumstances
leading to such mixture may be best observed in the
case of persons who speak more than one language.
Bi-lingualism on a large scale, of course, is best seen
where a community resides upon the confines of two
linguistic areas, as on the borders of England and
Wales. It may, again, be due to the sojourn of a
person in a foreign country: it becomes more marked
still when persons pass from one country and settle in
another; and still more when large masses of people
are permanently transferred under foreign domination
by conquests and by colonisation, as in the case of the
inhabitants of British India or the French population
of Lower Canada.</p>

<p>The knowledge of a foreign tongue may also be
imparted by writing, as when we learn classical Latin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
and Greek; but in this case, the influence exerted by
the foreign tongue is felt only by the better educated
classes of society.</p>

<p>In all cases where nations have been brought into
contact, and have been mixed on a large scale, bilingualism
is common. It is natural to expect that, of
the two languages employed, that of the more prominent
nation will gain a preponderance over the other,
whether its prominence be due to its power, or industrial
or intellectual capacity. There will be a
change, in fact, from bilingualism to unilingualism;
and the process will leave traces more or less marked
on the superior language.</p>

<p>An instance of this process on a large scale was
afforded by the Roman Conquest of Gaul, the consequence
of which was a struggle between the tongue
of the Latin conquerors and that of the Celtic conquered
race. The result was that the Latin ousted
the Celtic, but not without leaving traces of the Celtic
idiom in certain words, in the pronunciation, and the
construction of the language.</p>

<p>But it will be found that the mixture will not easily
affect single individuals, so as to transform their diction
into a language made up of elements equally, or nearly
equally, taken from either of the two conflicting languages.
Even assuming that a person is perfectly
master of both languages, and that he may pass from
one to another with perfect ease, he will yet adhere to
one language for the expression of a clause or a sentence.
Each tongue may, however, exercise a modifying
influence upon the other in the way of affecting its
idioms, its accent, its intonations, etc. It may happen
that the influence of one tongue may be predominant
in particular areas of language, as we see that the
English is in Lower Canada in matters of commerce.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
This leads to such expressions as <i>jobbeur</i>, <i>cheurtine</i>
(shirting), <i>sligne</i> (sling), <i>charger le jury</i>, <i>forger</i>, <i>cuisiner
les comptes</i>, etc.: see American Journal of Philology,
vol. x., 2.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Of course, where one of two or more languages
has been learnt as the mother tongue, this will
always have more influence over foreign languages,
however perfectly acquired, than the latter will have
over the mother tongue; but we must not under-rate
the influence which a foreign language may have upon
the mother tongue, especially when it is looked upon
as fashionable, or as the key to an important literature.
The influence of the foreign tongue may obviously
spread to persons who are wholly unacquainted with
it, by the contact of these with persons who have
adopted or assimilated the foreign elements.</p>

<p>The two principal ways in which a foreign idiom
may influence the mother tongue are these. In the
first place, foreign words may be adopted into the
mother tongue and retained, commonly speaking, in
a more or less altered form. The English language
has borrowed words of this kind from numerous languages.
Thus, from Dutch, we get the word <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">sloop</i>
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sloep</i>, itself a loan-word from Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">shaloupe</i>; whence
we, again, have borrowed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">shallop</i>), yacht: <i>yam</i>, from
some African language, through the Portuguese:
from Spanish&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flotilla</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cigar</i> (Sp. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cigarro</i>), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mosquito</i>:
from Italian&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">domino</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">casino</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">opera</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">stucco</i>: from Persian&mdash;<i>chess</i>
(Persian <i lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">sháh</i>, a king, through O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eschac</i>),
<i>orange</i>, <i>shawl</i>, <i>rice</i>, <i>sugar</i>. India gives us <i>sepoy</i>; Germany,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">meerschaum</i>; Russia, <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">a steppe</i>; China, <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">tea</i>; etc.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>In the second place, the method of connecting and
arranging the sentences, and the idioms used by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the mother tongue may be taken from the foreign
language, and this, even though the material of the
language be maintained intact.</p>

<p>The chief cause for the adoption of foreign words
into the mother tongue is, of course, the need felt for
them in the mother tongue. Words are constantly
adopted for ideas which have as yet no words to express
them. The names of places and persons are the
most common among such adopted words, to which
may, of course, be added the names of foreign products,
such as <i>tea</i>, <i>sago</i>, <i>chocolate</i>. The names of such
products may be taken from the language of communities
in a very low state of civilisation. On the other
hand, when a language finds it necessary to introduce
technical, scientific, religious, or political terms, it is
fair to suppose that the language which lends the words
must be that of a nation in a higher state of culture
than the language of the nation which borrows them.
There are many words relating to social subjects
imported into English from French which may serve
to give a good idea of the weak point of the nation
which borrows, and of the strong point of the nation
which supplies them. Such are numerous works
having reference to ease in conversation, such as <i>bon-mot</i>,
<i>esprit</i>, ‘wit;’ <i>verve</i>, ‘liveliness; ‘<i>élan</i>,’ spring;’
etc.; and it will be correspondingly found that the
language whence such supplies are drawn is very rich
in the qualities for which it possesses such abundance
of names.</p>

<p>But languages may be tempted to borrow beyond
their actual needs when the foreign language and
culture is higher prized than the native, and when,
accordingly, the usage of such words is considered
fashionable or tasteful. Instances in point are the
numerous Greek words introduced into classical Latin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
such as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">techinæ</i> (Plautus, Most., II. i. 23), and the
numerous French words borrowed by German and
English, such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étiquette</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaperon</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à outrance</i>.</p>

<p>If a speaker has an imperfect mastery of a foreign
tongue, he will be apt to employ, when endeavouring
to speak it, numerous loan-words from his mother
tongue. He will, in fact, insert into the foreign tongue
any number of words which may serve the purpose of
expressing the idea which he feels necessary. Such
loan-words, of course, take time before they become
usual. They cannot become usual unless they are
often repeated, and, as a rule, unless they proceed
spontaneously from several individuals as the expression
of a general need. Even then they may only
become current in particular circles: as when, for
instance, such technical terms as those applicable to
music are borrowed. Such words, when fairly accepted
by the language, are treated like other words in the
language, and are regarded by the speakers of it as
native, and inflected as such. Foreign words, when
borrowed, are commonly treated thus. There are no
two languages in which the two stocks of sounds are
precisely identical. Consequently, the speaker will, as
a rule, replace the foreign sounds by those which he
conceives most nearly to represent them in his own
language; and, in cases where the foreign language
possesses sounds not known in his own, he will fail to
pronounce these correctly, at least till after much
practice. It is well known how very seldom any one
masters a foreign tongue so as to speak it without
some incorrect accent. Thus it happens that in the
cases where a conquering language spreads over a
nation speaking a different language, the original
language of the conquered people must leave some
traces in the production of sounds, and changes will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
occur in other ways as in accentuation, etc. Numerous
instances might be cited of where such invasion of a
conquering tongue has occurred on a large scale, as in
the case of the Moorish invasion of Spain, the Latin
invasion of Gaul, the Norman-French invasion of
Saxon England.</p>

<p>In cases where one people merely comes into
contact with another in the course of travel or of
literary intercourse, the number of those who acquire
the language of the foreign people will be necessarily
small. The word will, therefore, from the outset, be
pronounced imperfectly; the persons who first introduced
the word or those who immediately accepted it
will insert sounds with which they are familiar among
the foreign ones. It thus happens that when a foreign
word has once made its way into a language, it
commonly exchanges its proper sounds for those
native to the language which borrows it. Even those
who know the foreign language most perfectly, and
are aware of the proper pronunciation of the loan-word,
have to conform to the pronunciation of the
majority, at the risk of passing for affected or pedantic.
For instance, in English, in spite of all the numerous
loan-words which occur in the written language, very
few new sounds have been introduced, such as the
nasal <i>m</i> in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</i>; and even these sounds are dispensed
with among the uneducated, and imperfectly reproduced
by many of the better educated. One common
result of the adoption of a foreign word into another
language is that popular etymology begins to operate,
causing the word to appear less strange to those who
have borrowed it, as in the familiar instance <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rose des
quatre saisons</i>, ‘rose of the four seasons,’ transformed
by English gardeners into <i>quarter sessions rose</i>.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<p>The changes which naturally affect foreign words
upon their reception into the language, must of course
be kept distinct from those which affect them after
they have become an integral part of the language,
when they change according to the laws of sound-change
of the language into which they are adopted.
In fact, it is often possible to tell the epoch at which a
word has passed from one language into another, by
noting whether it has or has not participated in certain
laws of sound-change. Thus, where in Old High
German the Latin <i>t</i> is represented sometimes by <i>t</i>,
and sometimes by <i>z</i> (as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tempal</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i>), ‘temple’
as against <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ziagil</i> (= <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tegula</i> = ‘till’), the form with <i>z</i>
represents an older stage of borrowing than the form
in <i>t</i>; and, again, words in which the Old High
German represents the Latin <i>p</i> by <i>ph</i> or <i>f</i>, must be
held to represent an older stage of borrowing than
those in which it is found as <i>p</i> or <i>b</i>: cf. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pfeffer</i>,
‘pepper;’ <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pfingsten</i>, ‘Pentecoste,’ as against <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pîna</i>,
(Lat. ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pæna</span>’): <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">priester</i> (Gk. ‘<span lang="fl" xml:lang="el">presbuteros</span>’).</p>

<p>Similarly, such a word as <i>chamber</i>, or <i>chant</i>, must
plainly have been borrowed before the period of
sound-change when the sound of <i>ch</i> regularly took the
place of the Latin <i>c</i>; and this we know to have been
the history of the <i>c</i> sound in the dialect of the Ile de
France, whence those and other similar forms come
to us.</p>

<p>But foreign words are exposed, after their adoption,
to the same assimilating forces as when they are first
adopted: and one of the transforming forces which
should be mentioned is the transference of the native
system of accentuation to foreign words. In English,
a study of Chaucer or Langland will show us how
French words originally adopted and pronounced
according to the French method of accentuation, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
degrees, and not till after a period of vacillation,
passed over to the system common in Teutonic
languages: thus Chaucer has <i>lánguage</i> and <i>langáge</i>;
<i>fórtune</i> and <i>fortúne</i>; <i>báttaile</i> and <i>battáile</i>; <i>láboure</i> and
<i>labóur</i>: thus Pope accentuates <i>gallánt</i>. Of course,
words may be so far phonetically modified as to
become unrecognisable even by persons who know
the language whence they are borrowed. Who, for
instance, would recognise in the word <i>pastans</i><a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé-temps</i>, our <i>pastime</i>; or in the common
Scotch word <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ashet</i>, the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assiette</i>. Thus, in the
same author, Gavin Douglas, we find <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">veilys</i> (calves),
representing the old French word, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">véel</i> (vitellus). The
strangeness may be increased still more by changes
which have occurred in the language from which the
word is borrowed. Thus our word <i>veal</i> represents an
older form of the French language than <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">veau</i>; and the
German pronunciation of many French words is that
of an older period of French pronunciation; as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">París</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concért</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">offizíer</i>. German words adopted by Romance
languages have been even more violently transformed:
who, in the French words <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tape</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taper</i>, would recognise
the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zapfen</i>; in the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">toppo</i>, the German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zopf</i>; in the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">touaille</i>, the South German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zwehle</i>; in the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">drudo</i>, the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">traut</i>? In
the same way, the signification of the word in the
parent speech may change; as in the case of the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emphase</i>, ‘bombast,’ as against <i>emphasis</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biche</i>
(‘hind’), etc. Finally, it may disappear in the parent
language and survive as a loan-word in the language
which has borrowed it; as, for instance, the French
word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guerre</i>, ‘war,’ in which survives the Old High
German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">werra</i>, ‘quarrel,’ the same word as our <i>war</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>The word may be borrowed several times at different
periods. It appears in different forms, of which
the more recent bears the stamp of the parent language,
while the older has been exposed to phonetic changes
which have more or less violently acted upon its form.
It will generally be found that the meaning attaching
to the word when it is borrowed a second time will
differ from that which it bears on the first occasion.
These words which are more than once borrowed are
commonly called doublets; they are very numerous
both in French and English, and have been treated of
at length by Bréal and Skeat. Instances of such are
<i>priest</i>, <i>presbyter</i>; <i>champagne</i>, <i>campaign</i>; <i>preach</i>, <i>predict</i>;
<i>prove</i>, <i>probe</i>. Proper names constantly afford
instances of repeated forms of borrowing processes; cf.
<i>Evans</i>, <i>Jones</i>, <i>Johns</i>; <i>Thomasson</i>, <i>Thomson</i>; <i>Zachary</i>,
<i>Zachariah</i>. It sometimes happens that a loan-word
long since naturalised in a language receives a partial
assimilation to its form in the language whence it
originally came; a good instance of this is seen in such
forms as <i>honor</i>, <i>color</i>, etc., which, especially in America,
are often so written, instead of <i>honour</i>, <i>colour</i>, etc.
Sometimes words are adopted into a language from
two kindred languages; the signification will then be
similar, and the sound will differ but little&mdash;the sense,
as well as the form, contributing to keep the two words
together. German has several of such loan-words
borrowed from the French and Latin; as, <i>ideal</i> and
<i>ideell</i>; <i>real</i> and <i>reell</i>; which at a former period had
an actually identical meaning, but now are differentiated.
In English, <i>spiritual</i> and <i>spirituel</i> differ like <i>spiritus</i>
and <i>esprit</i>. Some words, again, are borrowed from a
language in which they already occur as loan-words.
Thus the French have borrowed from English the
word <i>square</i>, O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esquarré</i>. Thus, again, Greek
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
words come to us through the medium of the Latin:
whence it is usual to write such forms as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æschylus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hercules</i>, instead of <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Aischulos</i>, <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Heracles</i>. Thus, again,
Latin words borrowed from Greek have come into
English through the medium of French&mdash;cf. such words
as <i>music</i>, <i>protestant</i>, <i>religion</i>, etc.; and also such proper
names as <i>Horace</i>, <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, and <i>Livy</i>. Persons
conversant with the original naturally refer such
words to the language through which they came; and
thus, in adopting Greek words, they employ the Latin
accent and the regular English termination which
represents that French termination whence the English
one came. Such words are <i>alopecy</i>, <i>academy</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Derivatives formed with unusual suffixes often receive
in addition the regular normal suffix. This is
specially the case when a native synonymous suffix is
added to the foreign one: as in Waldensian, Roumanian,
sometimes the native suffix is substituted for the
original suffix of the foreign language; as, <i>Sultana</i>, for
<i>Sultaneh</i>. Words are borrowed in their entirety; but
not suffixes, whether derivative or inflectional. When,
however, a large number of words is borrowed containing
the same suffix, these range themselves into a group,
and fresh formations are formed upon the analogy of
these. Thus, in English, after the analogy of such words
as <i>abbey</i>, <i>rectory</i>, etc., we have such words formed as
<i>bakery</i>, <i>tannery</i>, <i>brewery</i>: and, again, we find Romance
words like French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchard</i>, ‘a spy,’ Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">falsardo</i>,
‘impostor,’ with the Teutonic suffix: and very many
English words with a French suffix; as, <i>oddity</i>, <i>eatable</i>,
<i>drinkable</i>, <i>murderous</i>: and, again, <i>poisonous</i>, as against
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vénéneux</i> in French. In English, again, we find such
suffixes as <i>-ist</i> in <i>jurist</i> forming fresh additions to
their group by analogy, mostly, however, in educated
circles; as, <i>Elohist</i> and <i>Jahvist</i>, though such words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
spread eventually to the whole nation, as in the case
of <i>protectionist</i>. <i>-Ism</i> is another of these, as in <i>somnambulism</i>;
and <i>-ian</i>, as in <i>Hartingtonian</i>.</p>

<p>Inflectional terminations are also thus adopted, but
more rarely, and only between nations that have been
in close contact. In German it is common to use
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christi</i> as the genitive of <i>Christus</i>, and often the
French plural in <i>s</i> is applied to German words, as in
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Frauleins</i>. In English, we speak of <i>phenomena</i>, etc.,
and we employ <i>indices</i> in a mathematical sense.
The English genitive ending has found its way into
Indo-Portuguese, as in <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Hombres casa</i>, ‘the man’s
house.’ The gypsy dialects have adopted the inflectional
terminations of each country where they are spoken.</p>

<p>Words are sometimes affected in their meaning by
other languages; and further, the idioms peculiar
to one language are affected by those current in
another. This influence is called the influence
upon <i>linguistic form</i>. The most common instance
of the effect of one language upon another in this
case, is where, when two words partially coincide in
meaning, they are assumed to exactly tally in the
whole extent of their meaning. This is, of course,
one of the most common faults in translation. Thus
an English child, learning French, will often be
heard to use expressions like ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela n’est pas le
<i>chemin</i></span>,’ for ‘That is not the <i>way</i>;’ a German will say
‘<i>brought</i> a leading article,’ for <i>wrote</i>; a Frenchman,
‘Can you <i>conduct</i>?’ for ‘Can you <i>drive</i>?’ Sir Charles
Dilke, in his Problems of Greater Britain,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> gives an
interesting account of the French Language as spoken
by the French settlers in lower Canada. It appears
that the more educated of these speak a somewhat
archaic and very pure French, but that the peasant or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
shopkeeper will say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n’ai pas de change</i>, for ‘I have
no change.’ He will describe dry goods on his sign-board
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchandises sèches</i>, and will call out when
busy ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai un <i>job</i> à ramplir</span>.’ In public meetings we
hear of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les minutes</span>,’ and the seconder of a resolution
is called officially ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le secondeur</span>.’ The ‘speaker’
is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’orateur</i>, and ‘Hear! Hear!’ is rendered by
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecoutez</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes a word is coined in one language after
the model of one existing in another language, to
supply a want felt by the language which borrows.
This is especially the case with technical terms, as
when accusative, ablative, etc., are introduced into
English from the Latin model; and such words as
these are liable to be misunderstood, as they may only
tally with one portion of the meaning of the original
word, or, indeed, in some cases be a mistranslation,
as where, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genetivus</i>, ‘the begetting case,’ was taken as
the Latin equivalent of γενικός, ‘the general case,’ and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accusativus</i>, ‘the accusing case,’ of αἰτιατική, ‘the conditional
case.’ Another instance is the word <i>solidarity</i>,
which we have coined to express the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">solidarité</i>.</p>

<p>Again: entire groups of words, or idioms, are literally
translated from one language into another. Thus
we hear, in the mouths of Irishmen, such expressions as
<i>I am after going</i>, this being the literal translation of the
Irish idiom for the rendering of the future tense. Thus
the Austrians say <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es steht nicht dafür</i>, for ‘it is not worth
the trouble,’ because the Bohemians express this phrase
by <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">nestojé za to</i>. The following idioms are current in
Alsace;<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> it will be seen that they are literal French
renderings of German phrases. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce que cela vous
goûte?</i> ‘Does that please your taste?’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a frappé dix
heures</i>, ‘It has struck ten;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il brûle chez M. Meyer</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
‘There is a fire at M. Meyer’s;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce qui est léger, vous
l’apprendrez facilement</i>, ‘That which is easy, you will
learn it easily;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher ami, ne prends pas pour mauvais</i>,
‘Dear friend, do not take it amiss;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas si beaucoup</i>,
‘Not so much;’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attendez; j’apporterai une citadine</i>,
‘Wait; I will bring a citadin (drink).’ On the other
hand, the South-West Germans employ phrases after
the French model; as, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es macht gut wetter</i>, ‘It is fine
weather.’</p>

<p>Finally; the syntax of one language may exercise
an influence over that of another language. An
instance of this has been already given. The form of
the French language, which is a Romance language
grafted on to a Celtic stock, has been much influenced
by Celtic syntax (cf. the mode of expressing numerals,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soixante-dix</i> = 60 + 10, parallel to Celtic 3 <i>scores</i> + 10;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre-vingts</i> = 4 × 20 = Celtic 4 <i>scores</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>Again: as the Slavonic languages can employ one
form for all genders and numbers of the relative, we
find in Slavo-German the word <i>was</i> (what) correspondingly
employed; cf. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein mann, was hat geheissen Jacob:
der knecht, was ich mit ihm gefahren bin</i>.</p>

<p>Of course authors may consciously imitate a foreign
idiom with the view of producing a particular effect, as
when Milton wrote ‘and knew not eating death;’
‘Fairest of all her daughters Eve.’</p>

<p>In the case of dialects, almost the same remarks
hold good as in the case of different languages. Word-borrowing
is the most common process. Such words are
most readily borrowed as are needed by the borrowing
dialect for its own purposes; such as the Scotch words
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dour</i>, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">douce</i>, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">feckless</i>, etc. Sounds, on the other hand,
are not easily influenced by kindred dialects. The
nearest native sounds are commonly substituted for
those of the alien dialect. Of course the case may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
occur where two dialects have, in the course of their
development, so far parted that words etymologically
connected have lost all connection in sound. In this
case, the sound of the alien dialect will as a rule be
maintained. An instance of this is the Scotch <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">unco’</i> in
the phrase <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">unco’ guid</i>, which is really the same as
<i>uncouth</i>; but the accent has shifted, and this tends to
disguise the origin of the word.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE STANDARD LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>In all modern civilised countries, we find, side by side
with numerous dialects, a standard language, professing
to stand aloof from all dialects, and to represent what
may be called the classical form of the language. This
standard language is in fact an abstraction, an ideal, a
supreme court of language prescribing rules to be
followed in the case of each language. It bears the
same kind of relationship to the actual processes active
in language, as a particular code of laws to the
aggregate of all the cases in any district in which that
code is applied; or of a definite dogmatic text-book to
the religious practices and faiths of all the individuals
of a community confessing the particular faith embodied
in that book.</p>

<p>Such a standard language as we have described,&mdash;as
it does not result from the various processes natural
to the life of language,&mdash;necessarily differs from
language in general by its fixity; wherever a change
takes place in a standard language, the element of consciousness
is more clearly present than in the ordinary
changes of language. Not that a standard is absolutely
all-foreseeing in its provisions, or can claim to decide
on the entirety of the cases for which it gives the
example. A code of law, in the same way, or a confession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
of faith, may be liable to several interpretations,
and may not cover some of the cases which come under
its purview. Besides this, we must always take into
account the possible lack of intelligence on the part of
those who ought to act up to its provisions; and,
again, the feeling which must set in from time to time,
that many of the provisions of the code are obsolete,
owing to fresh moral or economical views which may
have become current since it was drawn up. When
such a feeling has set in strongly, the code is commonly
altered to suit the demands of the day. Just so the
standard language may, and indeed must, alter from
time to time; but its alterations are, like those of the
code, adopted designedly, or at all events with much
more consciousness than those which set into the
ordinary course of language.</p>

<p>This standard language is, speaking generally, the
language of a certain restricted circle in an entire
community&mdash;most commonly, as in England, the
language of the best-educated classes. The standard
language may be settled in two different ways: (1) by
spoken language; (2) by written authorities. Supposing
that a standard language is to result from a spoken
language, it is necessary that the persons who are
regarded as authorities should be in continuous and
full communication with each other, in order to keep
the standard as consistent as possible. Sometimes we
find a particular town or district cited as speaking the
language which is quoted as the standard. Thus it is
common to quote Hanover, in Germany, and Tours in
France, as places where the purest German and French
are heard. But it is clear that, even assuming the
correctness of such model towns or districts, none but
the better-educated classes even of those districts can
be looked upon as likely to maintain the standard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
language in its purity. In England, the standard language
can be defined in no other way than as the
language of the well-educated classes, who make it
their object to speak alike, and to exclude abnormal or
dialectic variations from the standard language. In
France, besides the appeal to the usage of the educated,
there is the further tribunal of the Academy, whose
verdict is final upon all questions of literary taste and
diction. In Germany, the language which must be
taken as the standard language is not that of any town
or district, but the purely artificial language employed
on the German stage in serious drama. This language
forms a very interesting and remarkable example of a
standard language which is consciously maintained as
the most effective medium of communication for a
nation which is more divided into dialects than most
other European nations. The stage language of
Germany is maintained by a continuous and careful
training, based on a knowledge of the science of
phonetics. The objects aimed at by the actors have
been twofold: in the first place, it was necessary to
practise an eclecticism in the choice of their language,
which should succeed in making it intelligible to the
largest number of German speakers: in the next place,
beauty and grace could not be left out of consideration.
Hence a fixed norm had to be settled on and maintained,
as it is plain that a consistent pronunciation
maintained unchanged is a main factor in promoting
intelligibility. Again, inconsistency in pronunciation
is practically the admission of dialectical peculiarities:
and such peculiarities at once suggest characterisation
where none would be in place. Those points, then, in
the varying dialects, were alone selected for this normal
language which seemed more conducive to clearness.
Sounds and intonations peculiar to any dialect were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
admitted into the standard language if they contributed
to this result. Syllables which had come, in the course
of time, to be slurred over on account of their light
stress were reinstated in the integrity of their original
sounds. The orthography was made to aid in the
reconstruction of the pronunciation. Such studied
straining after clearness must necessarily prevent the
stage language from passing into a colloquial language.
Its very clearness would savour of a stilted affectation.
But, with all its rigidness and precision, the stage
language still exercises some influence upon the sounds
of the colloquial language&mdash;considerably more than
that exercised by any particular dialect. But its form
is to a large extent poetical; indeed, it receives much
of its language ready made from the poets.</p>

<p>As we stated above, in the case of our own language
the only normal standard that we are able to
point to as the purest English is that commonly spoken
among educated people. In this case it is obvious that
the agreement between the different classes who aim
at maintaining the norm can be at best but an imperfect
one. Each class of educated men will have a
tendency to  fall into certain peculiarities of speech
which will mark them off in some degree from all
others. The language of the bar is not quite that of
the army. The language of the Church differs from
that of both. The language of the educated in England,
however,&mdash;in other words, the language of those
who aim at following the <i>norm</i>,&mdash;agrees in one respect,
that in all an emancipation from <i>dialect</i> is aimed at, and,
to a large extent, attained. This result is largely owing
to the fact that in England the better-educated classes
are in the habit of sending their sons to be educated
out of their own dialectical district, and the result is
that they come into contact, at an early period of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
lives, with companions whose language is characterised
either by different dialectical peculiarities from their
own, or by an absence of any. But even so it must
always be remembered that those who speak their
language in its greatest purity, <i>i.e.</i> with the greatest
absence of dialectical peculiarities, are subject to the
changes which mark all language and are an inseparable
concomitant of its existence.</p>

<p>But there is another means whereby a standard or
common language may become fixed, and may come to
serve as the normal or ideal language of the speakers of
any given language. This means is the reduction
of such normal language to writing. The reduction
of the standard language to writing renders it independent
of those who speak it, and enables it to be
transmitted unchanged to the following generations.
It further permits the standard language to spread
without direct intercourse. Of course, the influence of
a written language upon dialects is much more powerful
upon the material than upon the phonetic side. A
Scotch peasant may read a page of the <i>Times</i> every
day, and, if he reads it aloud to his family, the absence
of Scotticisms will act powerfully upon the younger
generation, and to a certain extent upon himself. But
he will probably continue to pronounce the standard
language in much the same way as his native dialect.</p>

<p>It is possible to make strict rules for the maintenance
of a written language, by adhering to the usage
of definite grammars and dictionaries, or of particular
authors, and admitting no other authorities. This happens
when, for instance, modern Latinists aim at reproducing
the style of Cicero, like Mr. Keble in his
celebrated Prælectiones. But if so-called purity of style
and expression be gained by this process, surely far
more is lost. The author writing under such restrictions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
must necessarily lose much of his power of original
expression, and must find himself very much cramped
in his vocabulary. In fact, writing at a period when
the whole character of the civilisation has changed from
that of his model’s epoch, he will find himself at a loss
for words to express his most common conceptions.</p>

<p>The fact is that a written language, in order to live
and be effectual, must change with the changing times,
and admit into itself words and methods of expression
which have become usual among those for whom it is
to serve as the model. It may maintain a conservative
influence by refusing to admit such words and
expressions too hastily; but it must allow of no absolute
barriers to their ingress. Modern Latin, in the
shape of the Romance languages, has survived, and
has proved adequate to the expression of modern
thought; but in its ancient form, it has died out as a
living language; and the fair dream of the Humanists
that the tongue of Cicero might serve as the medium
of communication to all civilised Europe was destined
to pass away unrealised, from the simple fact that they
insisted too strongly that this tongue should be exclusively
modelled upon that of Cicero himself.</p>

<p>A literary language which has emancipated itself
from its models must, of course, become less regular as
time goes on, and each individual who employs it
introduces into it some of his own peculiarities of
idiom. But it need not split up into varieties geographically
situated, as must needs be the case under
similar circumstances with spoken language. For
instance, the English written in America is much more
like the English written in England than is the dialect
spoken in Cornwall like that spoken in Yorkshire.
Sound-change, of course, under our present alphabetic
system remains wholly undenoted. Inflections, word-significations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
and syntax are of course exposed to
change, but to a less extent than in the spoken language.
Such a word as <i>bug</i> may have retained its older significance
of insect in America, and have been specialised
in England; but the word is written in the same way
in the two countries alike. Similarly, <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i>
may be exchanged, or one of these used to the exclusion
of the other; but they will remain spelt in the
same way. Besides this, it must be remembered that
the so-called classical models in any language will
always continue to exert a large influence upon those
who write in it; and this will always be an influence
antagonistic to change.</p>

<p>The method whereby a standard language may best
secure the greatest possible agreement over the largest
possible area, and may join to this agreement the
necessary adaptation to the changed circumstances of
civilisation, is by keeping to the ancient models in
syntax and accidence, and by allowing, at the same
time, a certain freedom in the creation of new words,
and in the application of new significations to old
ones.</p>

<p>Our great national languages are at once literary
and colloquial, and hence they possess a standard literary
language and a standard colloquial pronunciation
and vocabulary. The problem is how to keep those
two languages in harmony. The colloquial language
is, of the two, as we have seen, liable to change in its
phonetic conditions&mdash;a change to which the written language
is not so much exposed. It is therefore obvious
that the more a language changes phonetically, the less
will it be represented by the written language; and
it is also plain that in a language like English, whose
spelling is so very far from phonetic, the discrepancy
between the written and spoken language may go so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
far that the former may cease to exert much, if any,
influence upon the latter. To remedy this state of
things, phonetic alphabets have been drawn up, and
various reforms in spelling have been recommended
from time to time, in order to bring the written into
harmony with the spoken language.</p>

<p>The more that the natural language of each individual
departs from the standard language, the more
will he naturally regard the standard language as
something foreign; the effect of this will often be that,
as the discrepancies between his natural dialect and
the standard language are more clearly felt, he will
make a more conscious effort to seize and get over
those differences. Thus, in the border counties of
Wales, or of the Highlands, a more correct <i>literary</i>
English is spoken than in many English counties.</p>

<p>The different individual dialects of any country, <i>i.e.</i>
the forms of language used by each individual, are
constantly changing their position in respect to the
norm, or standard written language. On the one
hand, the natural changes incident to all language are
always tending to alienate these from the norm; on
the other, the conscious and artificial efforts made to
approximate the individual language to the norm are
constantly in play side by side with the other tendency.
The main method whereby this conscious approximation
is effected is, in the first place, the instruction
given in civilised countries at school; and, in this case,
the standard language, or an approximation to it, is
learnt at the same time as the language of the
district. But the dialect of each individual’s home
cannot fail to influence largely his acquisition of the
standard language. England, as before remarked,
forms an exception to most other countries in this
respect, that many children are brought up comparatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
free from the dialect spoken in their
geographical area.</p>

<p>But, when all is said, there remains to be taken into
account the difference in each individual’s pronunciation,
and his greater or less capacity for assimilating
the difference between the artificial dialect and his
own. These considerations will always operate as
powerful solvents of the integrity of a standard
language.</p>

<p>It must further be noticed that the stock of words
and their meanings, as well as inflections and syntax
of the artificial or standard language, are constantly
being recruited from the natural language. Instances
in point would be the different Scotch words, such as
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ne’er-do-weel</i>, adopted into standard English. Where
the same word occurs both in the natural and the
artificial language, it sometimes happens that both
words are preserved in the latter; sometimes with a
differentiation of meaning and sometimes without;
instances are <i>birch</i>, <i>church</i>, <i>shred</i>, as distinct from the
Northern <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">birk</i>, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">kirk</i>, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">screed</i>. It will thus be seen that
the colloquial language which serves as the model of
each individual is itself a compromise between the
strict normal language and the home dialect.</p>

<p>In the second place, the artificial language affects
the natural language by supplying it with words and
inflections in which it is deficient. Such terms would
naturally be such as the artificial language is more
fitted to supply. No dialect throughout Britain is free
from such influence as that described.</p>

<p>In the third place, it should be observed that when
persons speak an artificial and a natural language side
by side, the use of the former spreads at the expense
of the latter. The artificial language was originally
confined to writing, and was employed as a means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
communication with persons speaking a strange dialect.
Once established as an official channel of communication,
it has a tendency to spread to all literature,
and gradually to private correspondence. And this is
easy to understand, seeing that the young generation
generally learns to read and write from written records,
and that it is obviously easier to accept a form of
orthography made ready to our hand than to invent a
system of orthography which shall be applicable to
other dialects besides one’s own.</p>

<p>When the artificial language has once become the
fashion, then, and not till then, will the employment of
dialect seem a mark of want of culture. There are
many countries still in which the most educated persons
are not ashamed to speak in their natural dialect. This
is the case, for instance, in Switzerland and in Greece
at the present day, and, to a less extent perhaps, in
Scotland. It is therefore a mistake to suppose that
the natural language must necessarily be deemed
inferior or more vulgar than the artificial. It is, in
fact, the necessity for the employment of the artificial
language which causes it to be universally adopted.</p>

<p>We have now briefly to consider under what circumstances
a common language becomes established.
It seems to be certain that no common language would
have arisen without some necessity for its appearance;
and that necessity arose from the fact of the different
dialects into which any linguistic area must naturally
be split up becoming so far alienated from each other
as to be reciprocally unintelligible, and, of course, the
difficulty of comprehension would be greater in the
case of dialects, geographically more widely separated,
than in the case of those spoken by neighbouring
people. Indeed, the wider the area over which a
common language spreads, and the more numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
the dialects which it embraces, the more successful
does it commonly turn out. Good instances of this
truth are afforded by the Greek κοινή, and in that of
the Latin language in its spread over the Romance-speaking
areas.</p>

<p>We assume, then, in the first instance, the necessity
felt for a common language, before such is called into
existence. It is further an indispensable preliminary
that a certain degree of intercourse, whether literary,
commercial, or otherwise, should exist between the
areas, however distant they may be, which are to
partake of the common language. It might seem
natural to suppose that as soon as, and whenever any
certain given number of dialects had reached a certain
degree of difference from each other, there would
naturally be evolved a common language which would
suffice for their needs. But, as a matter of fact, we
do not find this to be the case. The common language
sometimes develops between two or more areas possessing
dialects less nearly related to each other, more
readily than between similar areas linguistically nearer
related, supposing that there are special circumstances
to favour the development. In some cases political
circumstances may effect this, as where a common
dialect for Germany was called into being on the basis
of a common German nationality. As a contrast to
this, we may take the case of Polish and Czechish,
which are, linguistically speaking, more nearly related
than High and Low German, and which yet, as in the
main belonging to different political areas, have no
necessity for a common language, and have therefore
never created one.</p>

<p>If a common language has once established itself in
a large area, it is rare for another common language
to arise for a portion only of that area. Thus a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
Provençal common language would be an impossibility
in the face of the powerful French which has spread
over the greater part of France. Again, a common
language can hardly arise for any large area whose
single parts have already some common language
which suffices for their needs. This may be seen in
the failure of the Panslavists to create a common
language in an area already occupied by Polish,
Servian, etc. No example of this fact can be drawn
from England.</p>

<p>The introduction of printing is a powerful aid to
the extension of a common language. Thanks to the
invention of printing, a written record can quickly be
communicated to a large linguistic area in the shape
given to it by the author, and an impulse is likewise
given to studying what is presented to readers in
such an attractive and commodious guise. But it
is necessary that the alphabet employed should be
identical for all the people in the linguistic area in
question; and, of course, the language expressed by
that alphabet must be widely understood over that area.</p>

<p>It should further be noticed that a common language
must, generally speaking, be based upon an existing
dialect, and that this dialect then modifies itself to
suit the demands of the different dialectic areas which
demand the common language. Thus, Luther expressly
tells us that he based his translation of the
Bible upon the dialect of the Saxon Chancellery:
Modern French is based upon the dialect of the Ile de
France: Chaucer chose the London dialect as the
most appropriate for his purpose. Such cases as the
modern attempts to form a common language in the
instance of Volapük, etc., have been but partially
successful; there was no strong existing basis upon
which to found them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

<p>It must be assumed as a necessity to the success of
any common language, that there are a number of
persons compelled by circumstances to make themselves
acquainted with one or more foreign dialects.
This may be brought about by the demands of commerce,
or from the fact that the persons in question
are compelled to live in the foreign linguistic area, and
to employ its tongue. We can see the operation of
these causes in such cases as the creation of such a
<i>lingua franca</i> as Pigeon English, which arises not
merely from the fact that the English and Chinese
who use it as a vehicle of communication are ignorant
of each other’s language, but further from the fact
that the Chinese who employ it speak dialects so
different as to be partially or wholly unintelligible to
each other. Similar remarks hold good of the Spanish
in South America,&mdash;which is learned by Italian
immigrants speaking different dialects, and serves as a
<i>lingua franca</i> to them. But even when such <i>lingua
franca</i>, or common language, has been formed, it is
liable in its turn to further development. It may
be influenced, for example, by the more perfect acquisition
of the standard language on the part of those who
use the dialect based upon it as a common language;
as is probably the case with the Pigeon English spoken
by the Japanese: or, by the adoption into the common
language of an increasing number of words from the
vocabulary of those who are gradually allowing their
own dialects to be superseded by the common language.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that a special dialect has been
selected as the model for a standard language, even in
civilised countries, we must not assume that it is
possible to adopt it as the actual and pure model. The
model dialects cannot fail to be influenced by the
dialect of the special speaker or writer, and in many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
cases this mixture may make itself very prominent.
This is especially seen, perhaps, in the case of literature
which, like journals and periodicals, is intended mainly
to circulate in the special dialectic area. Thus, for
instance, Americanisms, Scotticisms, and Hibernicisms,
are more common in the newspaper press of America,
Scotland, and Ireland than in the standard literature
published in those countries. Again, the dialect, on
which the model or normal language was based, will,
from the very nature of language, change more rapidly
than the normal language itself, which must from its
nature be more conservative; so that here, again, a
discrepancy cannot fail to set in between the dialect
and the model language. The truth of this may be
well seen in the changes which have passed over the
London dialect in comparatively recent times. The
habit of omitting the aspirate, or, as we say, dropping
the <i>h</i>, seems to be quite a recent development in
English,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and to have spread probably at the end of
the last century. Dickens’ Londoners frequently drop
their aspirates: and he seems to be the first writer
who makes his characters do this on a large scale. On
the other hand, the <i>ven</i> and <i>vy</i> of his characters are
hardly now heard in London.</p>

<p>And thus the artificial language, if it extend over
a large area, becomes differentiated into dialects more
or less strongly marked, in much the same way as the
natural language within a particular district. Probably
English is the language in which this fact can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
noticed more easily and on a wider scale than in the
case of any other language, from the fact that the areas
of English-speaking races are so widely separated in
many cases; and all isolation must tend to strengthen
the power of the dialect as against the artificial language.
So-called Americanisms, for instance, may be
older forms of the English language retained by the
American dialect and lost by the English. On the
other hand, they may be new importations into
the standard or model language from the colloquial
language, or from some dialect. These Americanisms,
again, spread to such English-speaking countries as
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand more readily
and quickly than they do to England. Consequently,
the artificial language, in spite of its tendency to
conservatism, is manifestly changing in the different
English-speaking areas, although the change is not,
of course, as great or as quick in its fulfilment as that
which comes to pass in the development of dialects in
the area of a definite territory.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to arrest to some extent
the change in an artificial language by the influence
of academies, who shall authoritatively decide upon
the permissibility or otherwise of the use of a certain
word or phrase; but under normal circumstances the
involuntary development which we have spoken of is
characteristic of a standard language as well as of
language in general.</p>

<p>A single linguistic area may, under the proper
conditions, develop a duality or even a plurality of
standards, though instances of the entire co-ordination
of two different standards are, in the history of
language, very rare. The classical example for the
duality of standard is offered by the linguistic conditions
in Greece during the period between 250 and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
50 <small>B.C.</small> Two types of normalised or standard language,
neither of them corresponding exactly to any
one folk-dialect, and each of them almost entirely
uninfluenced by the other, asserted their pre-eminence
over the folk-dialects in two distinct districts. The
one, which we may call ‘Eastern Greek’ or the Attic
κοινή, was based upon the Attic dialect; the other,
which we may call ‘Western Greek,’ was based upon
the Laconian. The former was the language of those
political and commercial interests that centred about
the Ægean; the latter, of those that centred about the
Gulf of Corinth. The former represented the new
cosmopolitan spirit of Hellenism, the latter the conservative
and provincial spirit that had its political
expression in the Achæan and Ætolian leagues.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, the levelling of the peculiarities
of provincial speech in the interest of a standard
language represents and corresponds to a levelling
of provincial barriers in the interest of a unitary
civilisation, and under the impulse of great common
movements of commercial intercourse, political organisation,
or religious thought, and the appearance of
two areas of levelling in language betrays the existence
of two areas of common commercial, political,
literary, or religious interest. The division of German
Protestantism into the Lutheran and Swiss wings,
coupled with political distinctions, availed to maintain
for a long time, even in the printed form, a Swiss
standard of German, as distinguished from the so-called
Modern High German.</p>

<p>To be distinguished from the cases of duality or
plurality of standard are those of <i>complexity</i> of
standard. A portion of a linguistic area, which recognises
in general outlines, or in the most essential
characteristics, the common standard of the whole,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
may develop inside these limits a secondary standard
of its own, which, in its turn, asserts itself as a unifying
influence above the disparities of the popular dialects.
Such is the status of the American-English, if indeed
it be admitted that there be any American standard
at all. The wide disagreement upon this latter much-mooted
question arises largely from a failure to recognise
what the true nature of a standard in language is.
In the light of the preceding discussion, and by the
help of the abundant available material, it cannot be
difficult to reach some consistent solution of this
question.</p>

<p>The attitude of the extremists on the one side is
well represented by the dictum of Richard Grant
White:<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> ‘In language whatever is peculiarly American
is bad.’ In other words, the absolute test of correctness
is the English standard, which is notably the
usage of the educated classes in the great centre of
English life. It must, however, be remarked, at the
beginning of any discussion of this sort, that the
question concerns not what ought to be or might best
be, but what is the fact. If it be actually the fact that
any considerable body of men, whose usage, be it
through respect for their culture, their intelligence, or
their position, or for any other reason, commands the
deference of the great mass of American speakers
and writers, follows so loyally the English standard as
to regard as bad in language all that is peculiarly
American, then it is the <i>fact</i> that there is no such
thing as an American standard in language. There
is, then, only one standard English speech, and that
the standard of London.</p>

<p>There exists, however, in America no educated or
cultured class in the English sense. The educated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
stand nearer the people than in England. The children
of the better classes are, furthermore, not so easily
isolated from the influence of the dialect of their
locality as in England. Certainly there exists in
general no class with which the popular mind associates
the idea of authority in matters of speech, nor
whose speech is respected or admired as correct. The
class of men most likely to be imitated and most likely
to exercise an unconscious influence upon the usages
of society is the intelligent mercantile class, but this
is not a permanent or well-defined body. Certainly it
is not a body likely to follow puristically a foreign
standard of speech.</p>

<p>It is in part this absence of a homogeneous usage
among the more intelligent and influential classes, such
as undoubtedly exists in England, that occasions the
apparently immoderate use of dictionaries in America
as standards of orthoëpy. So various is the usage in
the pronunciation even of many common words, like
<i>quinine</i>, <i>courteous</i>, <i>envelope</i>, <i>tribune</i>, <i>route</i>, <i>suite</i>, <i>wound</i>,
that the ear in its confusion of impressions fails to
decide definitely, and recourse must be had to the
dictionaries. It is most frequently in cases of doubt
like these that appeal is made to the greater certainty
of the English standard. It plays the part of a convenient
arbiter. This differs entirely in principle from
an attempt, for example, to introduce the totally non-American
pronunciation of <i>trait</i> with silent <i>t</i> final, or
of <i>bureau</i> with accent on the second syllable.</p>

<p>No single district or city in America ever has been
or can be generally recognised as furnishing a standard
of speech. Washington is in no such sense the
capital of the United States as Paris is of France;
New York is not a metropolis in the sense that London
is. Eastern Massachusetts, with its chief city Boston,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
enjoys a certain preëminence in the superior education
and intelligence of its people; but its local idiom, like
the general spirit of its population, is too strongly provincial
to attract any imitation. In fact, nowhere in
the United States have the schools and all their
adjuncts made more vigorous efforts to root out the
popular dialect, and nowhere does the English standard
receive so full recognition. The situation furnishes
a tolerably exact parallel to the rigidity of Hanoverian
German, an imported standard on Low German soil,
and constitutes a further illustration of the well-known
orthodoxy of recent converts. The schools of Boston
teach the ultra-English pronunciation of <i>been</i> as <i>bīn</i>,
while the native dialect has <i>běn</i>, and the American
κοινή has extended to general use the secondary form
<i>bĭn</i>.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>The stage is not yet in a position to exercise any
marked influence upon the language, to say nothing of
furnishing a standard. The influence of the pulpit is
probably greater.</p>

<p>But though neither the stage, an educated class, nor
any given locality has availed to vindicate for itself the
right of establishing a standard, it is an incontrovertible
fact that, within certain limits and to a certain
extent, an American standard of English does exist.
There is a great number of words, of word usages, of
pronunciations, of phrases, and of syntactical constructions,
which have, though not recognised in English
usage, a universal and well-accepted currency among
the best writers and speakers of America, and rise
entirely above all suspicion of provincialism. To
avoid or rebuke them, or to attempt the substitution
of pure English words or expressions would be only
an ostentatious purism unsupported by the facts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
society and the necessities of language, and would
expose the would-be corrector even to ridicule and
to the reproach of alienism. As has already been
remarked, we are not concerned in a case like this with
the ideally desirable, but solely with the existing fact.
On no other basis can the existence of a standard be
determined. If, for example, any one should, in deference
to English usage, assume to correct an established
and universally accepted American expression like <i>railroad
car</i>, which a well-known poet<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> has thought worthy
a place in serious verse, into its foreign equivalent <i>railway
carriage</i>, it would be generally regarded as an
odious affectation. The relatively few Americans who,
without any sufficient reason, but in a spirit of undisguised
and helpless imitation, affect to adopt English
manners, usages, and dress, are as a class notably
unpopular with the mass of Americans, and, as unpopular,
are uninfluential. What is true of their other
usages, would be in like degree of their language.</p>

<p>To illustrate from the vocabulary alone, there is a
large and constantly increasing body of non-English
words, which are used in all sections of the country,
which are shunned by no class of writers or speakers,
but which are universally used and esteemed as sound
and normal expressions. Such are <i>lengthy</i>, <i>to donate</i>,
<i>to loan</i>, <i>to gerrymander</i>, <i>dutiable</i>, <i>gubernatorial</i>, <i>senatorial</i>,
<i>bogus</i>, <i>shoddy</i>, <i>mailable</i>; these are slowly penetrating
into the English of England, and the path of
such words is rendered plainer by their previous
adoption in the British Colonies, whose linguistic
history is so akin to that of America. Many words
of this kind are of French, Spanish, Dutch, or Indian
origin, but have been so thoroughly assimilated into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the language by usage as to rank entirely with the
purest English element; thus <i>levee</i>, <i>crevasse</i>, <i>prairie</i>,
<i>canyon</i>, <i>ranch</i>, <i>stampede</i>, <i>to stampede</i>, <i>corral</i>, <i>boss</i>,
<i>stoop</i>, <i>squaw</i>, <i>wigwam</i>, <i>hickory</i>, <i>racoon</i>, <i>moccasin</i>, <i>hammock</i>,
<i>canoe</i>, <i>toboggan</i>, <i>hominy</i>, <i>opossum</i>, <i>terrapin</i>.</p>

<p>In determining the existence of a standard and
what may belong to that standard, we are in no wise
concerned with the <i>origin</i> of words or expressions. It
is not a question of origin, but a question of usage and
of ‘good form.’ The observation that <i>to guess</i>, in its
sense of ‘opinari,’ is found in Chaucer and Gower, contributes
nothing to either side of the discussion whether
there is or is not an American standard. The only
question is whether <i>guess</i>, ‘opinari,’ is in universal and
accepted American use. The fact is, that, though in
widely extended use, it still remains dialectic, and is
not a feature of the standard. The word <i>fall</i> for
<i>autumn</i> may in isolated instances be found in English
writers, and is undoubtedly with some meaning or
other a good old English word, but the fact is, that, as
a substitute for <i>autumn</i>, it is not ‘good form’ in
England, and is in America. <i>Spry</i>, ‘active, nimble,’ is
an ‘Americanism,’ because, though found in the
English dialects, it is a standard word only in America.
The American use of <i>sick</i>, in retaining the old English
value now expressed by the modern English <i>ill</i>, vindicates
rather than controverts the existence of a separate
standard. Differences in the uses of words common
to the two types are illustrated by the following: <i>lumber</i>,
in English, ‘cumbersome material;’ in American,
equivalent also to English <i>timber</i>: <i>tiresome</i>, in English,
‘dull, annoying;’ in American, ‘fatiguing,’ as ‘a tiresome
day:’ <i>to fix</i>, in English (and sometimes also in American),
‘to fasten;’ in American, ‘to repair,’ ‘to arrange:’
<i>corn</i>, in English, ‘grain;’ in American, ‘maize:’ <i>transpire</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
in English, ‘to exhale,’ ‘to become public;’ in American,
‘to occur:’ <i>bright</i>, in English, (of persons) ‘cheerful;’
in American, ‘quick of intellect.’ Cases in which
the two standards use different words for the same idea
or object are, Amer. <i>piazza</i>, Eng. <i>verandah</i>; Amer.
<i>bureau</i>, Eng. <i>dressing-table</i>; Amer. <i>elevator</i>, Eng.
<i>lift</i>; Amer. <i>sleigh</i>, Eng. <i>sledge</i>; Amer. <i>trunk</i>, Eng.
<i>box</i>; Amer. <i>store</i>, Eng. <i>shop</i>; Amer. <i>public schools</i>,
Eng. <i>national schools</i>; Amer. <i>academies</i>, Eng. <i>public
schools</i>; Amer. <i>to graduate</i>, Eng. <i>to take a degree</i>;
Amer. <i>student</i>, Eng. <i>undergraduate</i>; Amer. <i>druggist</i>,
Eng. <i>chemist</i>. Amer. <i>mush</i>, Eng. <i>porridge</i>; Amer.
<i>biscuit</i>, Eng. <i>roll</i>; Amer. <i>cracker</i>, Eng. <i>biscuit</i>; Amer.
<i>candy</i>, or <i>confectionery</i>, Eng. <i>sweets</i>; Amer. <i>pitcher</i>,
Eng. <i>jug</i>; Amer. <i>tidy</i>, Eng. <i>antimacassar</i>; Amer.
<i>postal</i>, or <i>postal-card</i>, Eng. <i>post-card</i>; Amer. <i>city</i>, Eng.
<i>town</i>; Amer. <i>fall</i>, Eng. <i>autumn</i>; Amer. <i>sick</i>, Eng. <i>ill</i>;
Amer. <i>rare</i> (of meat), Eng. <i>underdone</i>; Amer. <i>smart</i>,
Eng. <i>clever</i>. Many articles of clothing, especially men’s
clothing, have different names. Thus, Amer. <i>vest</i>,
Eng. <i>waistcoat</i>; Amer. <i>sack-coat</i>, Eng. <i>jacket</i>; Amer.
<i>pants</i>, Eng. <i>trousers</i>; Amer. <i>drawers</i>, Eng. <i>pants</i>;
Amer. <i>underwear</i>, Eng. <i>underclothing</i>; Amer. <i>waist</i>,
Eng. <i>body</i>, <i>bodice</i>; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Especially instructive it is to note how special
activities, particularly those of more modern development,
have found themselves in England and America
separate vocabularies. Let us take for illustration the
language of railways and railway travel: compare
Amer. <i>locomotive</i>, Eng. <i>engine</i> (also American); Amer.
<i>engineer</i>, Eng. <i>driver</i>; Amer. <i>fireman</i>, Eng. <i>stoker</i>
(limited in America to steamships); Amer. <i>conductor</i>,
Eng. <i>guard</i>; Amer. <i>baggage-car</i>, Eng. <i>van</i>; Amer.
<i>railroad</i>, Eng. <i>railway</i>; Amer. <i>car</i>, Eng. <i>carriage</i>;
Amer. <i>cars</i> (as ‘to get off the cars’), Eng. <i>train</i> (also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
American); Amer. <i>track</i>, Eng. <i>line</i>; Amer. <i>to switch</i>,
Eng. <i>to shunt</i>; Amer. <i>switch</i>, Eng. <i>point</i>; Amer. <i>to
buy one’s ticket</i> (not unknown in England), Eng. <i>to
book</i>; Amer. <i>freight-train</i>, Eng. <i>goods-train</i>; Amer.
<i>depot</i> (pronounced de̅e̅´po), Eng. <i>station</i> (gaining ground
in America); Amer. <i>baggage</i>, Eng. <i>luggage</i>; Amer.
<i>trunk</i>, Eng. <i>box</i>; Amer. <i>to check</i>, Eng. <i>to register</i>;
Amer. <i>horse-car</i>, Eng. <i>tram</i> or <i>tram-car</i>; Amer. <i>horse-car
track</i>, Eng. <i>tramway</i>. The Americans adhere to a
nautical figure, and speak of ‘getting <i>aboard</i> the cars.’</p>

<p>American political life has developed also a vocabulary
of its own. Some of these words have gained a
limited currency in England, but are mostly felt still
to be importations. Such political Americanisms are
<i>caucus</i>, <i>stump</i>, <i>to stump</i>, <i>filibuster</i>, <i>federalist</i>, <i>senatorial</i>,
<i>gubernatorial</i>, <i>copperheads</i>, <i>knownothings</i>, <i>carpetbaggers</i>,
<i>mass-meeting</i>, <i>buncombe</i>, <i>to gerrymander</i>, <i>to lobby</i>, <i>mileage</i>
(as a money-allowance for travelling), <i>wire-puller</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>Many words have received derived or special
meanings which have become established in general
and unquestioned usage: thus, <i>locality</i>, ‘a place;’ <i>notions</i>,
‘small wares;’ <i>clearing</i>, ‘a cleared place in the forest;’
<i>squatter</i>, ‘one who settles on another’s land;’ whereas
in Australia the latter word has developed into the
special meaning of one who rents a large area of
government land on which to depasture sheep.</p>

<p>Vastly more important for our purpose than these
mere differences of vocabulary are those differences in
phrases and turns of expression, which, as subtler and
less noticeable to the ordinary hearer and reader, are
less open to superficial imitation. Compare American
<i>quarter of five</i> with English <i>quarter to five</i> (also
American, but less common than the former); Amer.
<i>lives on West Street</i>, Eng. <i>lives in West Street</i>; Amer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
<i>sick abed</i>, Eng. <i>ill in bed</i>; Amer. <i>that’s entirely too</i>,
Eng. <i>that’s much too</i>; Amer. <i>back and forth</i>, Eng. <i>to
and fro</i>; Amer. <i>there’s nothing to him</i>, Eng. <i>there’s
nothing in him</i>; Amer. <i>named after</i>, Eng. <i>named for</i>
(also American); Amer. <i>it don’t amount to anything</i>,
Eng. <i>come to</i>; Amer. <i>fill teeth</i>, Eng. <i>stop teeth</i>; Amer.
<i>walking</i>; <i>lying around</i>, Eng. <i>walking about</i>; Amer. <i>are
you through?</i> Eng. <i>have you finished?</i> Amer. <i>that’s too
bad</i>, Eng. <i>what a pity</i> (also American); Amer. <i>as soon
as</i> (also Eng.), Eng. <i>directly</i> (‘directly he arrives’),
Amer. <i>right away</i>, Eng. <i>directly</i>, <i>straight away</i>; Amer.
<i>once in a while</i>, Eng. <i>now and then</i>; Amer. <i>quite a
while</i>, Eng. <i>some time</i>; Amer. <i>go to town</i>, or <i>go into
the city</i>, Eng. <i>go up</i>; Amer. <i>takes much pleasure in
accepting</i>, Eng. <i>has much pleasure</i>; Amer. <i>have a good
time</i>, Eng. <i>to enjoy one’s self</i> (also American).</p>

<p>It is not totally without significance that American
usage has established and confirmed a standard of
orthography that is in some few points divergent from
the English: thus <i>honor</i>, <i>honour</i>; <i>wagon</i>, <i>waggon</i>;
<i>check</i>, <i>cheque</i>; <i>traveler</i>, <i>traveller</i>; <i>center</i>, <i>centre</i>; <i>by-law</i>,
<i>bye-law</i>; <i>jewelry</i>, <i>jewellery</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Much that in English usage is approved and standard
sounds to American ears strange and outlandish.
The English use of <i>nasty</i>, for example, is to the
American, with whom it implies the quintessence of
dirtiness, distinctly abhorrent and all but disgusting:
even more may be said of the semi-colloquialisms
<i>knocked up</i>, ‘tired,’ and <i>screwed</i>, ‘intoxicated;’ while,
e.g., <i>haberdasher</i> and <i>purveyor</i> are as good as foreign
words.</p>

<p>The possession of a common literature holds the
two languages strongly together, and assures a narrow
limit to the possibilities of divergence. It is only
within this limit that the American standard exists.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
Freedom of trade and intercourse, that has come with
the building of railways and especially since the close of
the civil war, is rapidly replacing the local idioms with
a normal type of speech, and it is upon the common
usage in the chief centres and along the chief avenues
of commercial activity and national life that this normal
type is based. It corresponds to no one of the local
dialects, but stands above them all; it corresponds in
the main with the English standard, but maintains a
limited independence within the scope of certain
modern and special activities of American life.

This factor in the change of language (which has only recently
received investigation) cannot here be dwelt upon, as readers who
have not studied phonetics would be unable to follow the argument.
Such should at once endeavour to obtain at least a mastery of the
elements of phonetics, without which they cannot possibly understand
many of the problems with which we have here to deal, and
all should then read the very interesting article on <i>Phonetic Compensations</i>,
by C. W. Grandgent and G. S. Sheldon of Harvard University,
in Modern Language Notes, June, 1888, No. 6, pp.

A similar transference is observable in γέρανος, γρῦς, and in words

See the discussions of the examples below. The ‘various’
meanings of these words there given are mostly ‘usual’ ones. Whenever
a speaker utters any of these words in the body of his discourse,
the word has only one of the various ‘usual’ senses. The use of the
word ‘body’ in this very note may serve as illustration of an
‘occasional’ signification of a word with sundry ‘usual’ meanings.</p></div>

this point if Dr. Murray’s Dictionary has made greater progress than

Professor Almkvest kindly informs us that there are rules about
the grave accent in the Swedish, but that they are difficult to investigate.
The grave accent, as it occurs in Swedish, is quite peculiar,
and nothing similar exists in other languages.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the first syllable in <i>brä́der</i> (pl. of <i>brä́de</i> = board)
and <i>sånger</i> (pl. of <i>sång</i> = song) has the accent, but is musically
lower than the second syllable, which has a feeble secondary accent,
and is musically higher. This is different&mdash;in contradiction to <i>breder</i>
(pres. of <i>breda</i> = to spread), where the first syllable has the accent,
and is musically higher than the second syllable, which is quite
without accent.
</p>
<p>
It is the first-named pronunciation, <i>brä́dè</i>, <i>brä́dèr</i>; <i>góssè</i> (a boy),
<i>góssàr</i>, which has nothing corresponding to it in other languages.
</p>

accent), in <i>Transactions of the Philological Society</i>, 1877-79.

This symbol is somewhat different from the one employed by
Professor Paul, which is (<i>a</i> + (<i>b</i>) + <i>c</i>). Though we think the one we
have chosen is rather more simple, the other is not difficult to understand,
as symbolising the result of combining (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) with (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>).
If, instead of two similar sets of brackets, different ones were used,
say {<i>a</i> + [<i>b</i>} + <i>c</i>], the meaning of what now appears as (<i>b</i>) might be
clearer still. Professor Paul uses <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> as indicating three
different <i>parts</i>; we use three letters for three parts, but make two
letters alike, because two of the three parts have the same <i>function</i>.

Professor Skeat (Principles of English Etymology, p. 411) draws
a useful distinction between <i>homographs</i> and <i>homophones</i>, or words
spelled alike and those sounded alike. For our purpose, as students
of the spoken language, the homophones alone are of importance.
A homograph is commonly, but not invariably, a homophone; cf.

Or rather Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(je) cesse</i>. Just as, in the French language, we
must explain most nouns from the Latin accusative form, so in
English most of the verbs which we owe to French can only be
explained by the ‘strong’ forms, <i>e.g.</i> first person singular of the
present tense; as <i>complain</i> from <i>je complain</i>, and not from <i>complaindre</i>;
<i>to despise</i>, O.Fr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu despis</i>, not infinitive <i>despire</i>; <i>to prevail</i>, <i>je prévail</i>,

What follows is almost entirely taken from the article in Murray’s
Dictionary dealing with the suffix. Our excuse for reproducing
it is the unavoidably high cost of the work, which places it beyond
the reach of the ordinary student, so that a mere reference to it would
be useless; and, secondly, that we believe that in Murray’s otherwise
admirable treatment of the subject, one not unimportant side of
the question has been overlooked. To avoid misunderstanding, we
ought perhaps to assure the reader that what we give is not simply a
copy of the article in question; this will appear to any one who will
take the trouble to compare the two. Our object being different, we
lay more stress upon some points which are less material to Dr.
Murray; we, however, use his facts, and wish to acknowledge our
indebtedness.</p></div>

It will help us to realise the strength of the ties which united
these groups, if we remember that the modern pronunciation of the
ending, <i>tion</i> as <i>shun</i> is really quite modern, <i>i.e.</i> that, formerly, the <i>ti</i>
was in such words pronounced as <i>tea</i> and not as <i>sh</i>. The verb <i>abject</i>
consisted therefore of the first two syllables of the noun abjection,
<small>WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION</small>.</p></div>

A carefully compiled list of <i>all</i> forms in <i>ation</i>, past participles
in <i>ate</i>, verbs in <i>ate</i>, found in Dict. Murray, sub. let. <i>A.</i>, has given the
following results:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Forms in <i>ation</i> 219. Of these the first instance belongs to the
fourteenth century in 11, fifteenth in 26, sixteenth in 49, seventeenth
in 76, eighteenth in 23, nineteenth in 34 cases.
</p>
<p>
Among the 219, the form in <i>ation</i> is the <i>only</i> one in 89
cases, distributed over the same centuries as follows,&mdash;fourteenth, 2;
fifteenth, 9; sixteenth, 10; seventeenth, 31; eighteenth, 15; nineteenth,
22.
</p>
<p>
There are 138 verbs in <i>ate</i>, 20 of which stand alone. Distribution:
fourteenth century, 0; fifteenth, 4; sixteenth, 53 + 7; seventeenth,
53 + 13; eighteenth, 13; nineteenth, 15.
</p>
<p>
Of all cases where we find both the noun in <i>ation</i> and the verb in
<i>ate</i>, the noun is older in 74 and the verb in 34 cases. It seems plain
therefore that we may say that in English the verbs in <i>ate</i> are in very
many cases formed from the nouns in <i>ation</i>, and that both are chiefly
due to the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries.</p></div>

<i>Shoal</i>, the substantive from A.S. <i>scólu</i>, meaning either ‘a school’

fisherman’s phrase a ‘school of mackerel;’ while the adjectives <i>shoal</i>
and <i>shallow</i> likewise had the same meanings; but they have become
so far differentiated that the latter form alone can be employed
metaphorically; as when we say, ‘a man of shallow intellect.’</p></div>

In Hungarian, the plural ending is <i>-k</i>. But many nouns are
thought of as collectives, and have no plural. And if the noun be
preceded by a numeral, or by an adjective or pronoun of quantity, it
does not take the plural form unless the number embraces the
whole; as, <i>tiz apostol</i> (ten apostles), but <i>á tizenket apostolok</i> (the <i>twelve</i>
apostles). In the former case, the individuals are thought of <i>indefinitely</i>,
and so the sense of the individual is weak; in the latter case,
<i>definitely</i>, and therefore it is strong. Byrne, Principles of the Structure
of Language, vol. i., p. 435.</p></div>

It is altogether unimportant that, in the case of such a sentence
as the one which we took for our example, the ultimate result, as far
as the understanding of the meaning goes, makes practically very
little, if any, difference. Thus, we teach a child that three times
five and five times three are the same, because the ultimate result of
bringing together three fives or five groups of three each is identical.
Still, no one will deny that, for correct conception of the operation,
there is an important difference between&mdash;</p>

for the theory. Nay, even in practical life there would be
a great difference between going thrice, <i>e.g.</i>, to fetch five apples at a
time, and making five journeys for three apples each time. Yet
every one admits that 3 × 5 = 5 × 3 is a ‘truth’ generally quite
‘true enough.’</p></div>

It would be worth investigating&mdash;a question which only the
most extensive statistical collection of earlier examples of this construction
could decide&mdash;whether the very extensive use of this construction
in English is not due to, or has not been at least promoted
by, the existence of the so-called pronominal prepositions in Welsh,
and their construction. The personal pronouns are used in Welsh
as suffixes to the prepositions: <i>e.g.</i>, prep. <i>at</i> = to; <i>ataf</i>, ‘to me;’
<i>atat</i>, ‘to thee;’ <i>ato</i>, ‘to him;’ <i>ati</i>, ‘to her;’ <i>atom</i>, ‘to us;’ <i>atoch</i>, ‘to
you;’ <i>atynt</i>, ‘to them;’ <i>imi</i>, ‘to me;’ <i>iti</i>, ‘to thee;’ <i>iddo</i>, ‘to him;’
<i>iddi</i>, ‘to her;’ <i>ini</i>, ‘to us;’ <i>ichwi</i>, ‘to you;’ <i>iddynt</i>, ‘to them;’ etc.
(Rowland’s Welsh Grammar, §§ 374-381). These forms were used
especially in relative clauses; <i>e.g.</i>, instead of&mdash;

Psychologically: subject, ‘I asked him;’ predicate, ‘after his health.’</p></div>

Compare ‘the tother,’ <i>e.g.</i> in Wycliffe, Matt. vi. 24; ‘love the
tother,’ which took its rise from ‘that other.’ The word ‘ewt’ also

Forms like <i>fur-booted</i>, <i>blackeyed</i>, etc., do not, of course, belong
here. They are derived, with the suffix <i>ed</i>, from compounds or
groups like <i>fur-boot</i>, <i>black eye</i>, <i>eagle eye</i>, <i>cone-shape</i>, etc., or formed by
analogy to such derivatives. Some, indeed, are true compounds,
but then the second element is an adjective and not a past participle.
In that case they should be ranged under the compound formed
from two adjectives.</p></div>

Cf. M. Müller, Sanscr. Gram., § 249, which we here transcribe:
The comparative is formed by <i>tara</i> or <i>îyas</i>; the superlative by <i>tama</i>
or <i>ishtha</i>. These terminations, <i>tara</i> and <i>tama</i>, are not restricted
in Sanscrit to adjectives. Substantives such as <i>nri</i>, ‘man,’ form
<i>nritamah</i>, ‘a thorough man;’ <i>strî</i>, ‘woman,’ <i>strîtarâ</i>, ‘more of a
woman.’ Even after case-terminations and personal terminations,
<i>tara</i> and <i>tama</i> may be used. Thus, from <i>pûrvâhne</i>, ‘in the forenoon,’
<i>pûrvâhnetare</i>, ‘earlier in the forenoon.’ From <i>pachati</i> ‘he cooks,’
<i>pachatitarâm</i>, ‘he cooks better,’ <i>pachatitamâm</i>, ‘he cooks best.’</p></div>

It will be noted that in these examples, the more they are usual
the more they appear as compounds, and the less clearly and definitely
we feel the force of the first noun as adjectival; cf. a <i>maiden over</i> with
a <i>maiden speech</i>.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
